<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because as a New York Times reporter he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before any one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed down blueprints to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating breaches and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Council, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on breaches, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to risses.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of being able to fail and to make cracks, it could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone calls secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail, financial and banking information, his credit balance, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a source of CIA whistleblowers and risings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology has been developed by SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any form of contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to put away misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about misunderstandings in the supply of soldiers and report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee who alerts an alarm to the contaminated water by Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer folks and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing to this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states one needs less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to do this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very absurd as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama exposures, this huge view into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use legislation to end this type of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally stop the transparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet store.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the Peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock in?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is mad?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed on toe-tops to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moved out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for $20 on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely differently because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust by design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we entrenched.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked cell phone from your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gore's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 testimonials, all of which say: "he can hold really well-unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system decisively strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is a little surprising that we trust people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three opinions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation creates commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted passion.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one can tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, for example "great artworks in your home! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can one create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurt when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are trusting each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know a real thing.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want one to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is going.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of participation converge with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the matter is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a tavern neighborhood of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would make apartments for one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of isolation and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking places belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that with the components of trust one can find the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A gull fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga singing, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why are you repressing yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, questioned and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that anyone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, men jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was quickly turning into revolt.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard... "Muslim terrorists......"... in the name of Islam...... "... in the name of Islam..."... "close ancestry..."... "Jihad...,..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and begin the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember seeing myself -- when we were silent -- as deep as I went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be vigilant" "", "" "" "Be careful," "" "" "" "stay in well lit areas," "" "" "" "Don't gather." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed there all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings came:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were considered Muslims to be free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I've got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour can be removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people from going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, put her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam reestablished the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if people submit messages that have been negatively reported to Muslims, they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood swings towards Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraqi War and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">"" "" "" "so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I expected." ""</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear is harming all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did my brother become such an accomplished youth?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we left to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out of my shoes, and went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw was restrained.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam gave an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had encouraged panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than ours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble thinking factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I'd say, don't fool you. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people like an exception usually appear, the rule is often broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-pact has penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flying machines reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level, e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly away from remote controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one worked.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospin, the mechanically most simple remote-operated flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or controller interfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, a lot happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge-starter. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when all is watching is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospin is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not yet symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In doing so, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one constructs them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If anything goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- can keep the machine flying even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-Quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, wages are in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes round each other in a very remote galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">They did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Thirty-nine billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravity wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a last test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically that was the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and her through observatories as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a crush in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and squeezed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate the theory of relativity, teachers often perform a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice's talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally speak the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just round: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Spin the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional change of tone. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender the sound] someone who knows what to listen to, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- cannot be seen.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernova.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that things exist in space that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first run which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "that I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, upset me in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest one, calls for inexplicable reasons all" "" "kitten" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I was chatting to always playing with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which simultaneously in production are four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so far above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I don't just move around the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">To wear a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I explain to them the sum, I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I started working and working with TV production, when I began to work and work, build, create, and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you can not strive differently from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being no different than striving for greatness no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more things are at the same time, the more I write history, the more my expectations are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work-titan.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the sons of Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totality ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't really love my job anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I simply had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hay you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're working, you're doing what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz, if you already know the buzz, who is you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late in it and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone any more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my totals mourn, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Pods."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens that happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the buzzing, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I complain about broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sum.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing doesn't seem to me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful because what a person prefers to be a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of it is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We grate around in the garden, front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always craving for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teens daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even at a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totality of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "games" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'll slice and win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I listen to the totals. the country that I created, the marathons that I run, the troops, the sums, the sums, the other, the correct sum: the totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life is spreading within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the same sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll bring you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "depth brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the neurons "circuits in a way that improves neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is infected with skull-brain trauma and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save lives it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology instruction that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain rinds.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-planted them at the close-up point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autootransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-integrate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-integrate the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouforgiven we could work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed, they go back home.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplained exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-grafted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forage pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we had the motor skills range in the motorised cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who picked up spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can need it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to prove first of all that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his grand imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is actually dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are wrong, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brimming, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Top Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could carry out the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing, except to inflate stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the fact that the body kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my discord with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it seized the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">While the Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">It is also quickly burned like a candle that lights up very brightly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually stopping the economy and exposing it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power has migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators who have so sustainably decimated the animals they feed themselves, that they are therefore starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy which has canniated politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and business, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long the economy and politics are separate areas, automation allows the twin peaks to be higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts go deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hypercar bureaucracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or something similar to that of society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the "" "" Matrix "" "" -like dystopia? "" "</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples soon, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: imagine a capital market where money is earned while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to it. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- call it "the Cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can envisage real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide political together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do it, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not swirling, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner the orator you have very clearly said what you think of the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it takes place -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, when I can say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells great after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the self-complacency, and the continuing denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone and continues to run massive, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Area, have continued to denounce denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change enters, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which changes do you see ahead of us?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the lenders of finding a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were going on through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the liberated centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a postmodern 1930 what it seems to me, it will be just as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a snack bar and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will be.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is judged with nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after you have watched a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough about what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium bulge, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't thrill.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It requires guaranteed success, so it holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases stuff for free, do you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts one skips or reviewing.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican U.S. Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give to shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what kind of shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you hit, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the awful way of predicting -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data unimaginably to make serious choices, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help crush a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used the data to control all their decisions, first as they competed for TV ideas, than they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "We tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will then fuse it with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have heard in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it's not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
