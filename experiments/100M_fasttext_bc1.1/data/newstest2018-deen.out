Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the ru@@ sty cause of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to day .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everyone who had to get excited , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a stra@@ dd@@ ling street showed a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ se , which one recognizes as such .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called sentences , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; prim@@ eval &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
today , small plots show no more farmers - but farmers in the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or of the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ bacher was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft . &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the cigar@@ ettes of the so @-@ called mis@@ si@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was first place for 280 patients , and later it was expanded to 500 .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kra@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 , has been there since 2006 .
young people in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting in the area of the former auction .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural style to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony took place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group Anno@@ un@@ ces Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks by the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to be aware of extreme caution , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial incidents occur in the whole state last time , &quot; says the Group &apos;s statement .
a recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits , and the state &apos;s law enforcement agencies , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , led the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are considered to be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime report that classi@@ fies the state as regards the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that obli@@ ge local law enforcement agencies to arrest people on account of immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ dez@@ er@@ un project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ town @-@ association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fisher@@ man , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spontaneous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate income on such steep areas .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area cares for a lot of work , much has to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not conduct a bio@@ economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the turn@@ key project and is glad about the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of preservation is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of € 71 million was funded by the leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of wheat .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the state subsidies of green f@@ ences .
the aim is to preserve the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a conveyor system marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be protected must not be slu@@ gg@@ ish ( slope of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ u@@ ing project , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres .
the area of coverage corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have as@@ simil@@ ated him if he had done so .
but it took its significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma named Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the memorial was completed , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is lying properly right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the vibr@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who asp@@ ire to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coast@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s meaning .
Lazarus and her friends , who used to place their words on the basis of her death , knew very well that she had executed a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical representation .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : the mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful men after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a special team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
as for my speech as a Captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from being at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ aped in the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s headquarters left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigor@@ ous adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair loose after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum - is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans speaker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the govern@@ ors &apos; actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of bar@@ be@@ cu@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans in Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not full of hate , but she asked for hate crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crime and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea , when a number of people take a position on the same issue , they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor managed as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses or to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County hurt the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable money had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of writing stroke his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain prevailed , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an is hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the northern Iris@@ h@@ man , who last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades less and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the manager of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic that hin@@ ders construction works is a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are authorized to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the un@@ troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ated tu@@ ber is picked up and swal@@ lowed by ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a tile room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence for the Dutch regime quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal prot@@ esters .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ al and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has de@@ composed gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at valued 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military guards a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal homeland in the 1970 &quot; s have been committed to genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will W@@ ise Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants originate from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to stay here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the mother @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his 2014 election campaign , the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their lights on .
one of the soldiers took note of their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor , Y@@ av@@ edt , T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le col@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so hard hit that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bir@@ d@@ song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started casting stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cous@@ in , who witnessed sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that their officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they would be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the victims &apos; families and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the UN called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to take a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the Offic@@ ers to hold accoun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an issue for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by con@@ spir@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ at .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competi@@ tively .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chair@@ person of Pan@@ i@@ ai Chief &apos;s Council .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign , the limitations of reporting , were not realized in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the guidance of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him : &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua reports that they will probably not again vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , look at their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims launched a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the victim &apos;s body was buried in an area just across the police and the military station .
they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential houses in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , which in only two years is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise , which one random@@ ly calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident called George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) and cooling down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police told them that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play the Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very much valued five @-@ sentence classic , the traditional competition remains .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had come to finish the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists will have the host @-@ right in the following year in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training courses etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 American travellers get banned objects into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent were consciously or un@@ consciously banned items being s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet Charter Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travelers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed goods had been brought through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the greatest amount of items seized by T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA might watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers to cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
so far it has under@@ estimated that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
alongside the ever @-@ trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k presented another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started .
now Mus@@ k has been dre@@ aming of : 6@@ 3.000 re@@ trac@@ ted from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in the case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations suggest that Mus@@ k admitted into a telephone conference with analysts .
Tes@@ la &apos;s boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , it is expected that all models will be 500@@ ,000 by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations for this purpose .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect ex@@ tradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines never tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .

EPA Director P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ pul@@ ls the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
one day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline exp@@ iring October 1 for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt proclaimed in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or obstruc@@ t economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations affecting the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal back for the P@@ ru@@ hr regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement the deadline for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority given to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the Opinion of the EP@@ O that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually make use of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other powers available , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule by at least eight years .
this measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had lam@@ ented the EPA this week said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ h surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of the St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche we invite to a ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers tum@@ ul@@ tuous about their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ pass@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen with the Vog@@ tland &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wording of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a glorified court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ al law belonged and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the community centre of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 consoli@@ date these historical realities .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval equity .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath the church .
it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was destroyed during Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were sm@@ ashed and the clock parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hil@@ arion broke out .
only the tower was stopped .
in the New Year &apos;s 18@@ 34 , a storm split the tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present tower , which still exists today , remained a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers charge Tum@@ lin on Sunday , 16th July , for the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ arion chapel .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler College Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local manager Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
to conclude the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of great importance for tumours and audi@@ tors .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but this had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal condition , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received in the circle of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter once more .
however , they do not expect the trial to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the contents of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Bank plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ gel@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured .
two more people were injured slightly .
the state road remained closed for hours .
following police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to the city center .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will make the customers aware of what offers the own city offers away from the usual supermarket equipment .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip positions .
in addition , the shops of the city center are supposed to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , are Christian König .
city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city center . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well festival plus selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ ened , King had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen shared that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities took part in the third &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and make it more important for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour .

a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed .
a first missing was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of accidents , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
at the time of the holiday there were only a few people in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
pump put after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump urged the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump terminated the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull had said , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and moved to Ford &apos;s Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates float in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this man --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a re@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience ble@@ w very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ simil@@ ated by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of re@@ position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him the delivery serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medical exam@@ iner puts a sheet on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizen to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach , according to the FB@@ I , the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com has a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is gro@@ unded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness of all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh here is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he , swe@@ eps away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated by Ras@@ cona .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ ggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- er &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to meet the harsh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely because the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replaced by discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Raz@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dream dress stands above the bodies of the actors and brings Bil@@ lie Holidays the mour@@ ning glory &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers swe@@ eps sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ching rope away and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ g@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona is hu@@ g@@ ging two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the post with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky therefore fought to find words that felt the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and doing that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , he keeps Broo@@ ks farm at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ eyed setting .
the turn@@ table ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ fat@@ alists pose as rock energy , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that is attracted by his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ fat@@ alists - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize wonderfully as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier they dec@@ eive Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) and make a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk and enter the Kra@@ fl@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous fi@@ zz@@ ling Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight boy .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ acks Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
in stor@@ my celebrations , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who humble himself and bowed his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 he had to let go of a brilliant whi@@ stle conc@@ erto in 2013 , five years later he had great che@@ ers in which the scattered &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but there was also an understanding for his view .
I draw a positive resume .
Max crowd works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have graduated from high school .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
do a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably doing a social worker training in the youth @-@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and I &apos;m studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where one makes his FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in other words than in civil engineering ?
amount : sure , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , each having a different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds in order to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , that they will cut more than 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched in order to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced .
the job cuts , which the Director General John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will come in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann AG last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , announced a declaration by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive sentence . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the Bag@@ ram Air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which states are obliged to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s obligation to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Director Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which contam@@ in@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the bor@@ ough of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common Council wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of river Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a community room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will continue until the area belonging to the church community has so far been owned by the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project that is em@@ bla@@ z@@ zed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a space of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council is ho@@ vering to not see such a common room as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ oren@@ righteous living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has already been decided by providing funding for the current budget last fall , will be made possible by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a community space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision to signal the investor is that in this respect , one does not want to throw a bil@@ l@@ bar between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er - which is le@@ aning to the surrounding buildings - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - is possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , however , is this addition .
when it helps : it is unanim@@ ous that he passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not come forward so well , but now you rest at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the community room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to supplement the resolution shall be deemed to be three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices of the original program Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we sum up the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and badly injured .
as the police ha@@ st@@ ened , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was traveling around 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the altitude of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who was driving in the same direction gave priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the street , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic .
he met with a car that led a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital with a retreat car .
Bayern Munich has to ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern returns to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel worries at German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at last it was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance improvement in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expected a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights casts its spell over the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to the information needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in a first phase by 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
domestic demand is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels is to be updated via the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception is important when choosing location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Ticket to Ride will be extended .
&quot; on the Star@@ path the viewer experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
in addition , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although it lies much further away .
I also teach in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to d@@ oted to d@@ warf @-@ planets - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the stal@@ ks with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to compete in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated world Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s lightweight champion , down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ Di@@ visional world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you get champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Cli@@ ma re@@ marked that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight battle in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he valued Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the Tri@@ athlon Champion of Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to T@@ ire Plat@@ ters
during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection .
the car sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green belt .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured people , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , followed by traffic on the left lane at the accident scene .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 at the end of the season against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season op@@ ener Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free kick won &apos;t capture the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be so for the future that no one will be on line with Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experiences in the preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; nor do I know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain at the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko found@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is essential , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ decided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start of the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ matur@@ ely due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will certainly go into the meeting in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away only because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine has started performing tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , you should make the evaluation of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Organisation ( migration disgu@@ ise ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until today , migration verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to trial and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , she noticed that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Go@@ j@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the governing pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three bridge @-@ dependent bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Easy is sure the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
on Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap on the north side .
this is a border fast@@ ener that is also used as an operating system .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to take place .
the special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ vor@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special sense of intuition .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , local residents were informed about the project by hand bal@@ lot .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the Flat@@ cast in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which otherwise is difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented by the Vol@@ can@@ ic House ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle will invite R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and familiar names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the well square , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the Forum A World and one of the organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reported that he tried such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf wanted to inqu@@ ire in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ sic .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes slightly more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trumpet meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ freiheit tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and are leading solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo performer of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire to transc@@ end not only the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach also sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and they will eat it to the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
in spite of all this , the brunette female performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I had .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the school age , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some might call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as people of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal merchant from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom with no leadership and is unable to find a positive , striking message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ woman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open reply today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
acts of F@@ uner@@ al for Mali St@@ ou@@ pled Sol@@ di@@ ers
at a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
the Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ explained collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church f@@ arewell .
then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood by arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ini@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six highly trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , commander of the regi@@ ment belonging to the soldiers , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not prevent the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt at the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was communicated to the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to keep her in mind .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also posted the title &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House , declared .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ zo@@ ate , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard standing with the Dan@@ es in his 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ inging , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after losing the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising discharge of Green Party members from their Land@@ tag faction in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen combined its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to include it .
in this way , the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 offices in the parliament of Lower Saxony , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens 68 .
up to now the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
Th@@ üm@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide if it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the state parliament resol@@ ves as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ects the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be thoroughly insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called T@@ v@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somewhat curious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called herself a tra@@ il@@ or of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that they have returned their landing gear , which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the local pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to speak a foreign language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bundes@@ rat of Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the Australian T@@ v@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity , and in their fru@@ stration , their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend its de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with a personal career .
at that time the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the parliament .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on stamps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know at present , a health hazard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di assume the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the investig@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has immediately switched off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming known .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just like the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the products sold are transport @-@ ready and harmless to health .
if the residual substance content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , the production facilities are not directly responsible .
rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they must expect economic damage .
as always , there is too little control in serious cases .
is it missing only at the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 per cent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor in those cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ ready food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to right .
the pan@@ ed means that manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
as a matter of principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can safely make money so that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the team &apos;s financing by the wealthy family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must interact with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin their support when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
Club losses of EUR 30 million can be incurred during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P expansion period , which runs until 2018 .
and even though Plat@@ ini has dropped from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is on the look@@ out for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from businesses connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be regarded as a legitimate income .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar would come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors are going to be ambass@@ adors and that such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ selling .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Gad@@ ner , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y Board @-@ Cho@@ col@@ ate has produced chocolate for Swiss Life in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
every year , some 17 million small red @-@ white packaged jo@@ g boards spread to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ theast Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around CHF 1 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are at the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate bars divide Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline collabor@@ ates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the conf@@ ection@@ ers Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi von Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes business as well as Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective . &quot;
this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to reg@@ ain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting process principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in @-@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot where Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ lived impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s lower lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fire up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I suppose as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of W@@ et Hot American Summer .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring@@ leader icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues will be du@@ b@@ bed by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , like Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who we@@ ars a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is included - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who has been reduced to a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re as Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
hit against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
at the same time 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in Italy &apos;s ra@@ ids , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
over 300 police officers were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been conducting investigations against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the attor@@ neys in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Prix was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the studies focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with close ties to the Italian Ma@@ fia .
even an incident on the 27th of May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way of compl@@ aining large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the national register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ carri@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 national immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , data had been found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on sufficient human beings , EU citizens are also included who would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false al@@ locations led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on dealing with foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they came from there .
this proceeds from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it says that BA@@ MF is introducing such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state that they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can return it to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments to sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the female spokes@@ woman on the left @-@ wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the lack of asylum in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided blood don@@ or service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation hon@@ ors the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into its constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher wrote about the actions performed in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter distributed ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while keeping interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members spending a boost this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ alled that interest increases would be needed in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation raised by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing would likely exceed more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus that was released one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households remains de@@ bit@@ ing consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than markets await .
the markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecast down@@ wards for this and next year is 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast predicted in May .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened increasing expectations on interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report provided little excitement for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; income from income , &quot; but she added that wages would be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of her three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall sin@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers asking for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June although the Bank said this was expected and that it will attract again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Ber@@ lak@@ , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those with whom the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alleg@@ ation that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ posi@@ tivity Pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who question the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted , taken up and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of hum@@ ankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Green , Chairman of the Ter@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that the pre@@ p test medicine is procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country in order to protect people infected with HIV and that they will help us to step closer to the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a real estate passion , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge house to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to take advantage of the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the award .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper sky@@ light from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to have a longer effect on it .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all cutlery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers Fi@@ ght for a 500 Million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and Developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers invested 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - owns about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that Col@@ in has property worth 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in &apos;s proposed divisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court hearing took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but introduces Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early affair known by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Lukas and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and drag our sur@@ name to the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the presidential term of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico says that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a smo@@ other course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the President &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media di@@ ets .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television lasts for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habits under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaig@@ ners there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff made it a few times to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him , their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of advis@@ ers to give the president doub@@ t@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from .
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had spoken false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards are sent to dangerous criminals by the police all over Europe .
since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally , information from the population is hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the winter on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many cur@@ ses hide at holiday destinations and called it from Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wa , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
up to now , 36 of the online newspapers have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on foot of war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug out by the Council to prevent their occurrence .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced through shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birmingham &apos;s Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of the former Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt will be renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambi@@ ance Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenues from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building offered the District Court as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by establishing a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels , managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has purchased the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is done .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s really a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high level of inner city , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms is looking wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s no@@ tions are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also placed on the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ators Sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to familiar people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there were already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted at the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ers of the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kom@@ mand@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and asked the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible bre@@ aches of crimes and to decide whether to charge an indictment .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called anchor chains .
most of the time they are turned on if they are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Prosec@@ ution to invite persons to the inter@@ ro@@ gation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , already invitations were issued , which revol@@ ved around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to comment , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his senior campaign leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller does not let himself intim@@ id@@ ate in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the prosecution of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action which accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I &apos;m not going to be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have no reason to believe that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ale , repro@@ aches against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as Richard Ni@@ xon &apos;s Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired upon the president &apos;s insist@@ ence on the President of the Ministry of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could not be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west @-@ Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been detached from the sh@@ ank @-@ cow@@ l by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
with 175 miles of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
he does not assume a danger for people .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hor@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed several years ago .
a complete sh@@ aw@@ l is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it is quite a matter of fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it emerges after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l is the fourth biggest glacier of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it was disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ event@@ h would grow back or fall short @-@ term and possibly fall together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead back the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many el@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Survey has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years , thus counting to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to sc@@ ari@@ f the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been integrated into the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have left their first day of work .
the teachers of the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places that were to be missed this year .
nevertheless , the group is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ an@@ cies at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demands of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service affected by illness or age .
high time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the common application with his party .
he already caused a bad surprise when he questioned the number@@ ing of personnel and the other parties were ast@@ o@@ unded .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should aim with the trade unions , perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exist when you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be furnished , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the sound of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German relief organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ ri@@ ers &quot; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for a year , refused to comment on extensive alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ ail@@ ure &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that his crew is on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are supplied by traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard which over@@ sees rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first of all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
according to Minn@@ iti , the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine ham@@ lets , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in der Nord@@ pf@@ alz , to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ tem@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always long climb@@ s , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trials and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;

caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters provided welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ li@@ ga gears up for E @-@ Sport
will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium grid during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga societies that are increasingly involved in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg followed , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite a number of associations going on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be far more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at a competition level .
as in normal sport , Li@@ gen has long established itself in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and during the Asian Games 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and watch on nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to play in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and large @-@ scale tournaments .
sales are expected to lie at 130 million in three years .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ Consul@@ tant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already international .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports champi@@ ons Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot going on in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to glori@@ fy the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays as it always was in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter , because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy urged to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for a negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain vac@@ ant until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing down@@ wards when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said that he did not figure out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day when I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters for eternity despite all my pain we will carry for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with which I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get up , hop on a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter paid attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern accounts for a big season for the fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua liked immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the band@@ age divided to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the fed Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the with@@ stood could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ me was able to point out the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader among youth players , de@@ but@@ s and especially from the holidays , but he .
sugar is most likely to be distributed to those whom you want to keep in a mood .
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old thri@@ lled as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right rear , that is now its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ me seemed like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che thus , on de@@ vil@@ s , come out to join the achievements of the Asia trip ( folding also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , this worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le was running beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to succeed in the design of the game a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ familiar this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but certainly six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates O@@ FB ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ FB ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous football player has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and the O@@ FB ladies wishing all the best .
the Bavarian legi@@ onn@@ aire is a club colleague of Ö@@ FB @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ ers@@ Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and with our frei@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football team of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises the pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier University ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the priority list of the country .
still this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is to be the construction right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the Western circum@@ stance of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ ums@@ Talk , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .

the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the master crafts@@ man &apos;s exam and 2500 Euro for graduates in the course of ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , but at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) .
until now 29 vac@@ an@@ cies have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ owned mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of country roads by 2017 and 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a country &apos;s concept as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install exhaust gases designed to neutr@@ alize diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of comm@@ itting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called sealing devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several Volkswagen employees were accused and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll @-@ n@@ oses and the Lau@@ ghter against the Su@@ ff@@ ering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the best @-@ published carto@@ on carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ inian also records with 85 and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities inspired himself .
large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits at the drawing table today , works daily for almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find his dro@@ ll characters widespread worldwide .
he has also been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced elo@@ qu@@ ently .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions borne on d@@ rought conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to d@@ rought .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,@@ 200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ fe@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades or leave them at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : enemies , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and threats to federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ fe@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ od@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders involved in drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ fe@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tra@@ it@@ or .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we mi@@ str@@ ust it all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ fe@@ ce in the capit@@ ol of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a couple of blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and his ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ fe@@ ce , was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival @-@ cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , all the members of the gang bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security , following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ fe@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ fe@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the prosecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she went .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pu@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; smell a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ fe@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before , it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ fe@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighbourhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who designated the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ fe@@ ce focused on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of brother of former well @-@ known bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that led to a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack .
only a few months before , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was re@@ directed to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped out a few signs and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor in the morning for a demonstration .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have grown lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after Val@@ dez &apos;s assass@@ ination , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they said the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re@@ organized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ effective society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put themselves under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media fan group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border State of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note , allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border State of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tened .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ fe@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones started to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ni@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ fe@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers who stood guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ fe@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , where J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , the inter@@ ns asked me to send them to the street for reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mine workers have been so well received that experts have described it as a &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something from an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
his incredibly well preserved condition has astonished scientists who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ge@@ aring her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed missing out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground cl@@ unk .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you smile only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily fortified din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to get better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ im@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter shade is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by eating vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter shade - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es of the chal@@ k @-@ time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ghty monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet long ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed ash@@ ore by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ ters cover still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery win .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other .
at first , there is no information about the exact number of injured persons .
it was a light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the site of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich some ten kilometres of lag@@ u formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle smo@@ ker , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ ancing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you &apos;re sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an un@@ sweet@@ ened person or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket .
there is currently a test run on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be purchased through the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant passes seat Y at ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
one can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ d@@ ants , simply check in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their trip more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who frequently travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the greatest off@@ ences .
because of@@ ten@@ times , however , one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either credit card or identity card missing or a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or the big room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken up to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , which was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she lowered her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of police band and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , det@@ ained a different polic@@ eman to his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves .
even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad job to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it all came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question came with Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are portra@@ yed , for so I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the incar@@ nation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ bird Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook that energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense her energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police remain .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on trial for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went on the streets three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discussing about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the subject difficult .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sts ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build on the fact that a gallery is attrac@@ ting more customers in the city , from which other shops are benef@@ iting from , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area then ble@@ eds .
added to this : the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be the end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one rooms : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost weekly for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s ei for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sticks to the height of the rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is price @-@ priced at the top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall pass during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes up some@@ time .
or is it possible for the gh@@ ost bit gallery to drive all business from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and nobody needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall there is no more space thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
once the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly tra@@ ded diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and from which 30 portraits were created , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , al@@ beit some intellectual comment not just about the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carrying a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette stu@@ b and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use have become un@@ equal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ah Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President ruled on Over@@ seas judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump runs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid dividing lines he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des following the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take with is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video plant from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ on phone in the hands of the United States &apos;s disciplinary powers such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they k@@ alt your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter they wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if it was to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which coinci@@ de like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a coun@@ try@@ wide human ch@@ ase is under way for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who will be sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the police department of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the spot of events and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder , while the police actively sought the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bin , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case to be investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago &apos;s police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he insist@@ ed on susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic hint that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that charging and war@@ ping were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team has published an explanation for the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM accepted the second part of the road@@ map of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t give up anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlets r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one pre@@ fers to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being

from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ ged anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wanted to create clarity and transparency for his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next dealer
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called for help from outside .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , offer specific groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low feedback results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ e why .
companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the nearest U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als ever since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation , and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ gence will send you tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion caught regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats his staff badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have a simple way of achieving their corporate headquarters .
earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , as the Con@@ ver@@ cent company uses Con@@ ver@@ gence , problems that have previously been hidden from executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are unlikely to come as a surprise in view of the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ gence and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can provoke dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gains new insights into its employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it takes place at 11 p.m. when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot pieces and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players and it actually prolon@@ gs their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 a.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are scheduled to perform 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the rule change of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on her , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they d@@ ross their heads , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practices as soon as the camp is over , as soon as the camp is finished , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls , which has already cleared a safety net behind a gate post , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling down there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake feedback from third parties and then show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors who may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to solve hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook announced in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new Fac@@ ts Test will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to recognis@@ ing the stories of fac@@ tual sel@@ ectors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy Se@@ at River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan city of Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke ; for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ valued my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape nur@@ ses , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des hit a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing what one possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let all go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for diving on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century presented his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to raise hei@@ gh@@ tened . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz wish to keep the logo and slogan hidden until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of action have been asking since yesterday on the plac@@ ards at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action it is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they compete with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f can cost a mid @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the meetings .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of survivors .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , whom Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had referred to the overthrow attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ count ban on female soldiers , the newspaper wrote .
the great job in the army and security forces goes on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan claimed to fire more 7@@ 3@@ 95 state ear@@ ners , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the masters of the country .
three times they took their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years .
if this is true , NATO could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by giving the US the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; says Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race @-@ climb shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the race @-@ platform shuttle had been fought over and over again - now it should be quite fast .
before the end of the year , one should build on the ailing track on which the tourist road is running .
in order to secure the future of the race @-@ platform shuttle on a long @-@ term basis , construction work will begin again this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ating the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this important link especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Secretary of State Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be defini@@ tively agreed , declared expi@@ ation .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said At@@ tor@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race @-@ stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered regular in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g stations .
in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested in recent months whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future .
the route is also partly very steep .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah .
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy uses a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something Dun@@ gar and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R real@@ ises their increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what sick@@ ens out of the marginal areas can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Ma@@ iden &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
her builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a sem@@ b@@ lance of the Tr@@ ump era that political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly demanding to burst our filter bags .
less noticeable is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone they know , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they strug@@ gl@@ ed for decades because of politics , suddenly and stran@@ gely on the same side .
around the dining table it &apos;s certainly a good thing , but it &apos;s up to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the uni@@ fying effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ump@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario where Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ ab@@ len@@ ess in comparison to its standards .
I find myself now attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ic version of Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both found in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact one as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the music @-@ per@@ ishing music im@@ parts this strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since here two years old , an 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood firm , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he was re@@ port@@ edly suffered by the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death in an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters of hat@@ s and h@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , the mayor An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for school leaving the 29 students of the four classes voted under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle rising up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a hen dress , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken ; the eagle lifted up his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the inclusion of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ bies who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ lei@@ derer An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten indeed is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each quarter ven@@ der that he feels accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back in class pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the chicken time is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they were very reluc@@ tant because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ meter @-@ meter .
finally all students left a song of sum@@ mer@@ time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ time students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television , was quoted .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally killing people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and impose significant fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power station Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler announced to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that is done in their framework .
how long will the retro@@ fits be allowed to take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the producers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the issue of the environment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would prefer , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions are threatening .
in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony held by President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center as the first ra@@ pper .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will take part in the award .
the winner Le@@ ar , which has become known with progressive TV shows , has already announced to ren@@ ounce the participation at the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear of her view .
the Kennedy @-@ Zentrum , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the biggest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Builder , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a town Builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for a revision , taking into account the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub@@ contractor for the administrative community , the applicant has to present corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if this could no longer be fulfilled , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good sen@@ timent between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life @-@ worthy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a are@@ als and the low @-@ ho@@ stage parking lot have been initiated .
the zig@@ ony bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium rehabilitation is still an issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a town master there is much room for manoeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and nur@@ sery , it is possible to react flexibly to many things .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an eye for what is fit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved emphasizes the out@@ going urban Builder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end it &apos;s all about my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good professional knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning .
the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , urban development , administration of urban properties , urban farm with construction yard and urban gardening as well as under construction rights authority , including monument protection .
bicycle suspended on lines : southern railway line closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the crime scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ en@@ reich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in danger and also end@@ anger the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay of the railway and the costs of rail transport , even the cor@@ rid@@ ors of the railway customers could get to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be run without disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains had fallen on Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intestinal tract .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food cannot penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacteria type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , had not .
she assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , José M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening had his debut for S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed the start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent un@@ veiled this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing is &quot; drawing &quot; Dream@@ liner to the sky
the Boeing aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such commerci@@ als .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain worry .
only a fire of interference from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind out of the League - was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governing provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise faction of a Green party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal executive Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters &apos; will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n for the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ ghs when on Friday morning the new Job Message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Stephan Wei@@ l , Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , El@@ ke T@@ westen meets CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the preliminary cli@@ ma@@ xing of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the un@@ expect@@ edly pronounced defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades settled at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the SPD &apos;s defeat brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , and the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te revol@@ ved around the party .
the comrades worked ti@@ res@@ ently in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communications he was pretty much wrong about what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
huge survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l increasingly tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in the past weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain concealed in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because Wei@@ l finds no fault in the internal party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mr@@ s T@@ westen combined its own career choices over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for its person , but has been elected to Parliament on the state list of the lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony parliament continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; wil@@ der four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career present of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to elu@@ ci@@ date the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding fees for local nucle@@ us III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again given a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been a lot of re@@ visions in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg passed two thirds of the funding amount .
in the area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is also important to promote the inner development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the commun@@ e sensation .
how is a re@@ development area now being created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in the development of interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed again .
the bar represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renovation would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per property .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the funding period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , it would only be possible to take stock , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , it should take place as possible as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned prec@@ ep@@ ts .
it is a question of evaluating and determining the urban disp@@ arities and deciding when it is rehabil@@ itated and in what extent .
for the respective land there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come back to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Ar@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the restructuring intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Domestic and H@@ ousing Ar@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; func@@ tioned first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or puts himself on a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .

the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn during the last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military information provided to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wisconsin Fire@@ fighter and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forklift .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the notes of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation .
the news indicated that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 3@@ pm and stayed until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft served in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about using the Pres@@ idential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products manufactured from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirements of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Com@@ missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
at that time , the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained a sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , at any rate , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer , S@@ V above all imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their roofs and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) is his first bet in this season .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress put in a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed the US blow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , co @-@ funded with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Route 2 .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to resur@@ rec@@ t the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could a@@ vert and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the Municipal Children &apos;s Day facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
it is still cooked outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked meals .
the town operates 46 day@@ care centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week in the K@@ ita have lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces start kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered dishes , supplement them with salads , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , give away food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s also about eating healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a familiar force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has displayed in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical way it means from the press office .
and this , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy at around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ dn , am@@ using head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ elled in the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an election for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections will be handed over to the next for the first time peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ ny said that a strong role for women will exac@@ erb@@ ate the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern on investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make sure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 people work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ in said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members .
generations of families worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the representative at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB delegates at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we realize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t indul@@ ge in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after leaving an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to subscribe to one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G Middle @-@ Field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication vis @-@ à @-@ vis the German Press Agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed the fact that reports of violence in Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
regarding the interventions in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes were a very normal ped@@ ago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with reports of mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e brothers Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was subjected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it says that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by master master R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal was rati@@ fied by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against prot@@ est@@ ors at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible to the farmer when a cathedral treas@@ ury provided no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 page long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
at best , one can reproach it , experience it too late or have taken the first hints not seriously enough .
the Cathedral Sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also made an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion , which even led to rage out@@ breaks .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just cr@@ ush the key@@ ring and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also drew ear @-@ cow@@ ards to the hair or ears , he had admitted already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you know these breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are , of course , Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just collap@@ sed .
many people who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot was reported in connection with the report on mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger given in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional way .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that it was rep@@ uted to him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer , or even more likely to have opened compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of everybody .
thus he cannot be accused of not being able to prevent or have brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and excessive violence as well as , let &apos;s say again , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and portra@@ yed , all of them occurred at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where sc@@ andal@@ ous circumstances must have reigned .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with George R@@ atz@@ inger because he got the boys first when they were already on the cathedral @-@ spell gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , as most witnesses stress , the topic &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline indeed , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , when the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
thus , at most , the reproach remains to have been looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral &apos;s gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows yet .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; hence the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horri@@ ble at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that of the past .
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will be finished .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , thus drawing ear@@ marks and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did George R@@ atz@@ inger see in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test sentence also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said from his perspective , because the cathedral cats played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not conc@@ eal that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one makes out of un@@ ru@@ ly young@@ sters no big singers and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experience as wonderful , humor@@ ous , ground@@ goodness , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only hurt a fly .
I receive regular contact with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his gradu@@ ation , visit him regularly , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched her life and told them the world of music .
and that he is always a good pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and whom they down@@ right worship .
and please , once more clearly : everything you propose to him is educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the An@@ c@@ ite would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who earned great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally at peace .
