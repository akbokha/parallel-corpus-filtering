<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the rusty cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everyone who had to get excited, because the car-Navi instead of a straddling street showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickenteppse, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called sentences, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched away with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling were concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbers from the so-called "primeval" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots show no more farmers - but farmers in the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or of the hill" "" "Auf der Lüft" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Irrenbacher was created "On the Auer Lüft."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the cigarettes of the so-called missiles." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was first place for 280 patients, and later it was expanded to 500.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krasirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich Salesianum are now meeting in the area of the former auction.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural style to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "main place" "", "the shopping street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony took place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Announces Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colors issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racial attacks by the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to be aware of extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial incidents occur in the whole state last time," says the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination suits, and the state's law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately target minorities, led the group to release the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by Missouri General Attorney General in which it is shown that black motorists in the state are considered to be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report that classifies the state as regards the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people on account of immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezerun project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-town-association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of the" "" "Fischbach" "" "fisherman, he called the" "" "spontaneous" "" "project as" "" "elementary important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate income on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area cares for a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not conduct a bioeconomy.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the turnkey project and is glad about the leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of preservation is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of €71 million was funded by the leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White stood firm:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the state subsidies of green fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to preserve the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyor system marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be protected must not be sluggish (slope of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischbacher Weidezuing project, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of coverage corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have assimilated him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma named Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the memorial was completed, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is lying properly right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who aspire to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coastlines."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about America's meaning.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends, who used to place their words on the basis of her death, knew very well that she had executed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservatism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Her Captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season, which included the victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "being a special team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>

<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as a Captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped in the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's headquarters left the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair loose after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum - is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governors' actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of barbecues or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans in Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of hate, but she asked for hate crime.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crime and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also don't appreciate this idea, when a number of people take a position on the same issue, they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor managed as a" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses or to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County hurt the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable money had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of writing stroke his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions who criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain prevailed, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by conspiring sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM guides are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never dive again.</seg>

<seg id="353">Poverty boosts discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabat.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosperous migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitively.</seg>

<seg id="364">Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua although they were given the rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's election campaign, the limitations of reporting, were not realized in order to promote transparency and development.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's untroubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supported by the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmantha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media, making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="373">The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they were belatedly discovered that they had gone astray with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the TSA were 19.7 percent of millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that have been deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly carried items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely smuggled - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who are most frequently flying.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">So far it has underestimated that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">Alongside the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk presented another, less glamorous figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk frequently had over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk has been dreaming of: 63.000 retracted from the 518,000 preorders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In the case of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations suggest that Musk admitted into a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">Tesla's boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, it is expected that all models will be 500,000 by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are currently 1,800 reservations for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from getting away in droves.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche we invite to a serenade on the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters tumultuous about their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urpassbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen with the Vogtland "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, was also a glorified court, to which the church or the patronal law belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the town image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the community centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 consolidate these historical realities.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval equity.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath the church.</seg>
<seg id="478">It was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was destroyed during Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the clock parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hilarion broke out.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's 1834, a storm split the tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower, which still exists today, remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "creative retirees" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters charge Tumlin on Sunday, 16th July, for the sixth serenade on the old cemetery at St. Hilarion chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler College Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local manager Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organizers set out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of great importance for tumours and auditors.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlin feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim" "" "sees no legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim" "" "has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but this had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a lack of form.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal condition, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the trial to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the contents of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Bank plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bathroom Langeneier and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend will make the customers aware of what offers the own city offers away from the usual supermarket equipment.</seg>
<seg id="535">A market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship positions.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city center are supposed to invite you to "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The action aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, are Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="541">The commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive city center."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers, such as the first "active day" to the well festival plus selling Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be reopened or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping from the view.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to enliven the city center - to landlords, businesses of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network that was partly broadened, King had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen shared that five Thuringian cities took part in the third "homeland-shopping" day for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="550">In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="551">"" "the day should" "" "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and make it more important for the common good of our cities," "" "says Streich." ""</seg>
<seg id="552">The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour.</seg>

<seg id="708">In other words than in civil engineering?</seg>

<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must eventually prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make money so that Neymar will sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's financing by the wealthy family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must interact with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin their support when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">Club losses of EUR 30 million can be incurred during the current three-year FFP expansion period, which runs until 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini has dropped from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of 44.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from businesses connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be regarded as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar would come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are going to be ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG anticipates that Neymars's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricotselling.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best soccer players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last owner of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the casting process principle, among them a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy vicious plot where Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-lived impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of random madness that could fire up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I suppose as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ringleader iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues will be dubbed by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"" "but" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "is so very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single." ""</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who has been reduced to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef constantly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a banquet.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a real estate passion, resized in 2014 from a large Knightsbridge house to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to take advantage of the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper skylight from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to have a longer effect on it.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went into it," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is mutual, so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while simultaneously using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers Fight for a 500 Million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate empire Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers invested 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that Colin has property worth 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "Colin's proposed divisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the Supreme Court hearing took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but introduces Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair known by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, whereby Colin claims Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Lukas and Mark were," "" "Paul says about the terms of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the presidential term of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico says that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a smoother course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the President's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diets.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television lasts for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were convincing," "" "said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habits under control, according to six ex-election campaigners there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times to keep annoyance from him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the fondness of advisers to give the president doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had spoken false accusations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made of the former Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt will be renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiance Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenues from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district, the hotel building offered the District Court as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group LuisenHotels, managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is done.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's really a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should be" "" "nice" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of inner city, Scherer stresses.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms is looking wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's notions are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the level of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The exterior installations are also placed on the front, which is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigators Sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the panel recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "referring to familiar people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being targeted at the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand who acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at more and more Trumps private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderkommandator Trump had personally moved into the centre and asked the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible breaches of crimes and to decide whether to charge an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called anchor chains.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on if they are larger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Prosecution to invite persons to the interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, already invitations were issued, which revolved around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to comment, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his senior campaign leader Paul Manafort also participated in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mueller does not let himself intimidate in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the prosecution of an indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action which accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI boss James Comey said three times that I'm not going to be determined against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to believe that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rationale, reproaches against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said before a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as Richard Nixon's Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired upon the president's insistence on the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the special investigator could not be dismissed so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the west-Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has been detached from the shank-cowl by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until he was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 miles of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">He does not assume a danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of Larsen-C-Schelhors.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcowl is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shawl is crumbling there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It is quite a matter of fact that the Larsen-C-Schelcowl is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it emerges after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelcowl is the fourth biggest glacier of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Scheleventh would grow back or fall short-term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many elves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Survey has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years, thus counting to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to scarif the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been integrated into the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the administrative district in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have left their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers of the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places that were to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should develop" "" "a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demands of skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus on the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">It sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service affected by illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time for action so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, will go beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already caused a bad surprise when he questioned the numbering of personnel and the other parties were astounded.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers' association.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU is trying to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envisages the tariff for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist when you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be furnished, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the sound of NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat to the German relief organisation "Youth Retriers" because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only for a year, refused to comment on extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Retailure', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew is on board dinghy migrants who are supplied by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard which oversees rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or obstructions" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">According to Minniti, the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium grid during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sports has long been a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Bundesliga societies that are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg followed, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be far more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA will be contested at a competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, Ligen has long established itself in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And during the Asian Games 2022 e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1637">But robbing also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to play in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring, and large-scale tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to lie at 130 million in three years.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter paid attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1752">"" "the BMW Group said that" "" "there are smarter options as travel restrictions," "" "and moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles." ""</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install exhaust gases designed to neutralize diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of committing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called sealing devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States several Volkswagen employees were accused and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the win of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1777">At times Mordillo was one of the best-published cartoon cartoonists, the noses of his characters are his trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first few years as an artist he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist of cities inspired himself.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, round Mordillo figurines cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own specifications, he still sits at the drawing table today, works daily for almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks continue to find his droll characters widespread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand footer as a counter-player.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film that is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions borne on drought conditions and insect-borne insects, causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium, the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The little town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1,200-year anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Krämer, Zundles, Dealers, Vagators, or a land extermination camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Rifece usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades or leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: enemies, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses accumulate, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats to federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Rifece, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Rifece, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we mistrust it all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rifece in the capitol of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a couple of blocks until his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rifece, was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival-cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, all the members of the gang bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security, following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Rifece and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Rifece, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the prosecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I would like to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompuviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead? why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the riodoce Andres Villarreal said "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Rifece met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rifece in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who designated the governor themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Rifece focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led to a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was redirected to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped out a few signs and went to the office of the prosecutor in the morning for a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have grown louder throughout the country by writing in organised protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an ineffective society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put themselves under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media fan group "Articulo 19" has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border State of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note, allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border State of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicized the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for danger.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with rivnivals and security forces near the Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>

<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mine workers have been so well received that experts have described it as a "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something from an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition has astonished scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the gearing herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed missing out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy ground clunk.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you smile only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily fortified dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to get better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markimchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shade is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by eating vorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the counter shade - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores of the chalk-time must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons weighty monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet long (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured herbivores were washed ashore by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur preserved his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutters cover still bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin cover still the bumpy armored plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometres long Staus - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the Autobahn Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first, there is no information about the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the site of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich some ten kilometres of lagu formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ reporter, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle smoker, who now have to reckon with delicate punishments.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dancing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group test "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you're sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use this, however, some requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased through the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant passes seat Y at ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who frequently travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the greatest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes, however, one of the contributors does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either credit card or identity card missing or a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or the big room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional train numbers on the same route are not yet available.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the road," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., which was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She lowered her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, detained a different policeman to his rifle and cried:" "" "I'm going to kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "said Ferrell to her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and cried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe?" "" "she recalled what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take it with me," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad job to keep them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it all came." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came with Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, for so I shall be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love and married her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the incarnation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Ferris's story also repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have shaped the film "Blackbird Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "" "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to its identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook that energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossroads as a black gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police remain.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on trial for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a chant and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went on the streets three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discussing about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausts), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery is attracting more customers in the city, from which other shops are benefiting from, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area then bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added to this: the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost weekly for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's ei for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "Gerd Densing:" "" "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sticks to the height of the rent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this should not be very low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that's superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is price-priced at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall pass during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes up sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible for the ghost bit gallery to drive all business from Bitburg before? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall there is no more space thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Once the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly traded diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Manning and from which 30 portraits were created, like someone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit some intellectual comment not just about the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black and white selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carrying a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoah Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President ruled on Overseas judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump runs a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid dividing lines he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological sense, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take with is that our genome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video plant from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a hands-on phone in the hands of the United States's disciplinary powers such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they kalt your speech, then they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which coincide like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A countrywide human chase is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who will be sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police department of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot of events and detectives investigate the engravings as murder, while the police actively sought the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbin, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem should now be assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of Chicago's police department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he insisted on suspects to submit to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce" "", "Guglielmi said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called for help from outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to address surveys, offer specific groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low feedback results - so that you can reboe why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the nearest Uber who has been involved in scandals ever since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint this desire is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation, and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convergence will send you tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion caught regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats his staff badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have a simple way of achieving their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the Convercent company uses Convergence, problems that have previously been hidden from executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair placements - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Ms Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are unlikely to come as a surprise in view of the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company that's worth their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergence and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve renders when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, this can provoke disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much relied on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2252">And who you don't care about, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gains new insights into its employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for diving on a broader base in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in the mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes a step to Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy uses a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point to something Dungar and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR realises their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what sickens out of the marginal areas can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maiden ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to its "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a semblance of the Trump era that political divisions, which polarized the US voters, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly demanding to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticeable is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone they know, including the republican kinship with which they struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table it's certainly a good thing, but it's up to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the unifying effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the grumpy possibility that his kittens will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario where Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself now attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of Crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both found in comparison to Trump in fact one as very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the music-perishing music imparts this strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, since here two years old, an 11-year old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood firm, while I wearied the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to death in an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time for a revision, taking into account the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a subcontractor for the administrative community, the applicant has to present corresponding conclusions.</seg>

<seg id="2545">If this could no longer be fulfilled, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food cannot penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>

<seg id="2633">Five months before the Parliament election, his red-green coalition lost its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green federal executive Michael Kellner has called on the rebellious Lower Saxony Green Party Elke Twesten to return her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the voters' will.</seg>

<seg id="2645">The SPD's defeat brought the SPD into staggering, and the Düsseldorf-Pleite revolved around the party.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades worked tiresently in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just picked up new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communications he was pretty much wrong about what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>

<seg id="2653">Due to the VW-Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now.</seg>

<seg id="2676">Back then, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg passed two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area II between 2005 and 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the previous restructurings are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote the inner development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>

<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, it would only be possible to take stock, in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, it should take place as possible as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned precepts.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn during the last month costs taxpayers according to the military information provided to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin Firefighter and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the notes of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news indicated that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on the South Lawn on July 17th at 3pm and stayed until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commandant wrote.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen" report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication vis-à-vis the German Press Agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticized the fact that reports of violence in Domspatzen's Domspatzen is measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the interventions in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one likes to go to the church and this is a found fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "strokes were a very normal pedagogical tool" "" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "it would be unfair to apply today's standards for previous decades, as the world has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports of misuse cases, pope brothers Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was subjected to" "" "high plausibility" "" "between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says that Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by master master R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal was ratified by the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence against protestors at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible to the farmer when a cathedral treasury provided no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 page long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach it, experience it too late or have taken the first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Cathedral Spatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - "Redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also made an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotion, which even led to rage outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just crush the keyring and threw the keyring on the floor, but also drew ear-cowards to the hair or ears, he had admitted already years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know these breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence at the preschool, these are, of course, Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working zealously at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot was reported in connection with the report on misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger given in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "said one concerned representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students evaluate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that it was reputed to him... Buben intrusive or clearer, or even more likely to have opened compared to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">In terms of sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of everybody.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of not being able to prevent or have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "to read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excessive violence as well as, let's say again, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and portrayed, all of them occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where scandalous circumstances must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with George Ratzinger because he got the boys first when they were already on the cathedral-spell gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most witnesses stress, the topic "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline indeed, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, when the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the reproach remains to have been looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral's gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "hence the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that of the past.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm glad that it will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, thus drawing earmarks and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he was strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "did George Ratzinger see in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, because the cathedral cats played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one makes out of unruly youngsters no big singers and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experience as wonderful, humorous, groundgoodness, deep-believing and heartfelt people, of whom one can't imagine that he could only hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I receive regular contact with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his graduation, visit him regularly, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched her life and told them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectable person, to which they still look up today and whom they downright worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: everything you propose to him is educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Ancite would command a 93-year-old man who earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally at peace.</seg>
