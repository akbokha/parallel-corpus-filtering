28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally he went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco and shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations were underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos; family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment he had a friend , &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia shared K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
his way of connecting with his family was to cook us a little , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to call the S@@ F@@ PD booklet under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston should not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put in drawers or get stuck by the outside label that usually has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a television with lo@@ cker@@ el de@@ bris and Mexican food , that &apos;s what it means in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says Hollywood Star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they ch@@ ased home to the for@@ ages in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended already again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he let himself be led with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe presented the &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; to the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small gala .
the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man does not lack acc@@ ol@@ ades .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting young children for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes , Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ reiter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports survivors came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
of the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those doubts small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive regul@@ ations massive , and he &apos;s strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must fulfill certain tasks , it has opportunities to open up and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the meantime , Tr@@ ump and Clinton had to be invested in almost word @-@ to @-@ word .
the democratic candidate fores@@ ees the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are traditional democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions at Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ cal trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid better then , for example , Clinton calls for .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says that the minimum wage must be up , then he says that he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every woman fle@@ eing has experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the president of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen have fled .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the setup together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are pursued politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope bearer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution in their homeland .
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ gs for a bottle of water require a sexual act , is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr tells us .
here , too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior or ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr requests .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are floors in some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there may be - constantly - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read by the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been spoken about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance specialists strike : demands for new work campaigns
Deputy Members have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have refused to address the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the agreement being rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns which commen@@ ced at the beginning of September .
the disputes lead to the fact that this year &apos;s assistants struck the first total cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he told B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical students that the Treaty should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ party in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared cl@@ ums@@ y and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve .
the next day , a newspaper compl@@ ained that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if anything bad had happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s out@@ shining , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was fur@@ ious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin negotiated and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
going on was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ve@@ x is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media made a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved in Russia when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , state television announced cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment goes beyond the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected bodies after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well @-@ understood for Moscow that even a deep @-@ seated fear of regime changes .
the summit in this da@@ zz@@ ling palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel ill @-@ treated and now unite .
nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents told at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress that .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
on Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan the BBC Scotland announced that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself almost collap@@ sed and had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and listing notes at Nat@@ West will be changed .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail banking that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already declared that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ die , on his local race track with his second prize of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the jubil@@ ation when he fet@@ ches victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differs from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a has fascinated fans for years for this kind of sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand@@ children jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already had almost 30 years winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5@@ 5th birthday .
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff un@@ expect@@ edly .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special commission@@ er for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without stating grounds Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy to Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it reads ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the governing body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your work as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works as he is working for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust a complaint for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov to be one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally , Putin &apos;s , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president for three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical debate on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .

I was hoping to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in Ban@@ ff Garden
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ aw@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain who lives about 500 meters from the sea , Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck@@ fittings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 inclined ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
altogether , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tor said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off at Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing vessel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI b@@ ail@@ out station hit 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we let go to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging at a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck and are still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop@@ over , but this dis@@ b@@ anded in the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
badly injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police ha@@ st@@ ened yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol addic@@ t cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the tent , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by his hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
the latter then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken much more seriously in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a settlement is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , you will have to reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prec@@ ep@@ ts as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is failing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now buy out@@ going bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in West@@ stadt there are dead@@ lines at the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not mean the owners , the housing estate companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will be some movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather prefer spending their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and last to smartphones .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclude each other .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest was falling in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand over@@ bur@@ dened by the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and as soon as they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ fut@@ ed each day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of subsequent fol@@ ks , who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; take &quot; 30 minutes time , &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day , &quot; appeals to de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ owing game spo@@ ilers , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should I do ?
it has made itself a breakthrough .
even when Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to track our activity earlier , they did not give us any reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time .
based on Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ned Tower
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the bar .
st@@ unn@@ ingly on the ground .
across the line brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast laugh@@ ed on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team k@@ amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tower on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multiple battle title and the fifth , while she rein@@ forces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years , winning 15 world championship med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired Chief Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit into the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 she has not lost any more competition , a winning series that will last as long as she wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was guided by two turns , the picture d@@ wind@@ led .
floating Be@@ ams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ks .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and put on top of it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently when she awa@@ ited her end - a mere form@@ ality - and tears poured out on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in her collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise they cast a com@@ eback to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the fast spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in a car in series production
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks for a decade as they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a weapon of hand while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told me that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police spokes@@ man Jonathan Howard said that shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was taken half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder on an empty Pick@@ up truck and assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his pe@@ ers , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t make it .
I did not let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been informed that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot talk .
but he is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something out of it . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS news .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented a few characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency booth on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that requests for flood @-@ boats , boats and sand bags continued to increase .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing through the tro@@ dden rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still linked people from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ be on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly raised overnight .
he said that another son of boots , who lives nearby , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer informed about 13.@@ 75 inch ra@@ ins near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and classroom loss in five school districts .
the WW@@ W C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a secondary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now floo@@ ded .
the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the town of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and provided sand bags for residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ au from the Municipal Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but there were no reports on Friday until now .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; sculp@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police noted that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation .
&quot; he made a lot , his small body was blown out by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported to the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ ten for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ came the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Inves@@ tig@@ ator Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ anism in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Roman Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female gymn@@ asts was an African @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold in an individual fight for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the pinn@@ acle of this kind of sport , but we do not see sports classes anywhere in the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same road as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to bring it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ships in the team . furthermore , the last year Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i is a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport , and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued at will .
the majority of these sports clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the congregations inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training .
I founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
at my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to get interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ e of the Olympic team and thank you for starting their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors , who voted in favour of election , rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty in force and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be det@@ ri@@ mental to the employees and patients .
the first assistants should receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend ser@@ endar@@ s in order to improve care for hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance doctors announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ence doctors have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current crisis of staff and will cut it up to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
the B@@ MA &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes through talks met with the government for reluc@@ tance and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the result of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made last month about that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , raise the vibration and address the worries of assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to have a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors , who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor battle measures reach nothing of only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months we have talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and the whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ sting with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from a professional time , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , continuing education and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was employers who were health education UK and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend treatments available to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness can blo@@ om electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread voting in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing governmental report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and city coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it would be allowed the police to set off barrier tapes outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters need to demonstrate their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a vot@@ er merely has to name its name and address .
the report suggests that non removable ink can be applied to a person &apos;s finger when they give up their vote to prevent anyone sel@@ ects twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special tri@@ bunal decided that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal vote - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading expressions to prove identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or b@@ ang@@ ian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... government institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists are working on brief@@ ing documents in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap suff@@ rage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
perform systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter of letters .
ban on political activists to edit full postal code and envel@@ opes of postal code .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change in the law , which facilitates an accus@@ ation due to intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act of 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English is allowed in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone to the elec@@ tive cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices because of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he ple@@ aded not guilty to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitu@@ encies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of Parliament , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come this week about the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , besides the border and the band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only ath@@ lete fighting for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one can give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : crew member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the crew member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star in a very similar way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see a big simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it up as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British femin@@ ist Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes shall be able to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one corridor higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : foot@@ ball@@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory placed in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons include K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner at Tur@@ unen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200@@ mt Wi@@ emo@@ sta@@ ffel ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; went off like a low &quot; and during the race , like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming pool .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought to board the C@@ BS comment@@ ator on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , as I had called , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming team 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , which enabled the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ Far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken down that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many were talking about
Twitter users didn &apos;t hold back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming power has been broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formula , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with people responding to the No@@ tice on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
last night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in social media .
in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formula . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that she was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming team in the C@@ BC , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman trying to wear under@@ wear in the middle of the store
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mar@@ row store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back in the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the store without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out their own h@@ osen trousers and pants and ta@@ sted them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everybody star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelves . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went on and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how re@@ prob@@ able that someone would take home pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber .
if you approached from behind you should turn around first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with his knees in the body and twist , while the attack@@ er crum@@ bles from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the as@@ sail@@ ant on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ tening the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler canc@@ els his immune system and saus@@ ages in a serious test by le@@ aching some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ab@@ bled his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pull @-@ out button on a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before stain@@ ing each object , he used a lumin@@ aire to show himself and us what he is going to get .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ k@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to check the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling around the world and eating odd and wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to flush links of toilets , the task put its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ aires were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ k@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ iny than that !
I won &apos;t wake up here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ k@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things that I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to Ian to put them in and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty marks on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ tian family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation of £ 50,000 , because it had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were g@@ aping holes , wooden boards were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who worked for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was worried that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demoli@@ shed under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood panels were torn
neighbours testified that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called on a regular basis by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was acclaimed by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have had the family to co @-@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant refused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall housing .
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the congregation who have gra@@ c@@ efully approached us and have given us the information they have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the floor
workers of the House administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on received a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to ow@@ ning a class B drug in merchant &apos;s view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Air Force announced that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no risk of security .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashed over a full shore .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers at the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped when they began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ ent@@ racks without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flo@@ ated incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility due to the poor visibility caused by close proximity to the area , the air forces persist@@ ed in such a way that the security was at no time at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , four of which came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is the first step to win the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inners will have to ab@@ stain from the sub@@ du@@ ed Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League Champion amongst others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision in this regard and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen appeared in most other competitions .
before the first mandatory play of the new season there is no doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ vision@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince .
Sevilla , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of this race .
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow coun@@ try@@ man and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Ran@@ king first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made the titles one among themselves .
this made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ actors on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches until here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang was said to be logical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected stirring match did not develop .
nevertheless , a sufficient number of stunning b@@ ale changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had contracted a ri@@ b injury and afterwards had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become Olympic venues similar to high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump acknowled@@ ges ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now revealed weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment when the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire normally appeared in a grand and self @-@ confident manner as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts arise in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for assistance in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media schol@@ ar .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equ@@ ated by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump at the front , but not with the distance common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the station CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything else than to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was ok , Tr@@ ump added .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump Party should have threatened to cut funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present better results .
instead of this , the Republi@@ cans advoc@@ ate the Congress more strongly under arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ght fraud in dop@@ ing tests
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud inspection in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer to his home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately shared a Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ inary Commission in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ enter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing control engineers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to make their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the outcome of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed over and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup Vi@@ erter .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is supposed to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks published by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
before the summer Olympics in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have always been raised that are easy to access in Kenya and give it a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this way , it was possible to demonstrate that in this sport @-@ type surface @-@ covering and systematically damp@@ ened .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shakespeare @-@ Jahr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her boy@@ friend with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I used as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli adds the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as impressive today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sultan , one of three British ma@@ ids leaving London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London rose to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory near Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands recognition since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants to calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to release Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude journal of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishing since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds commun@@ e Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even become &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believes the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the harsh en@@ cro@@ achment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community in Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime further op@@ poses the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already over@@ seen Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey .
after the vain put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even receives refugees in their own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ min@@ ated or displaced in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Defence asked the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ung as Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ wing , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey there are not those who fled from war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum seek@@ ers pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : the natives receive nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for it is not so stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and land bal@@ dness - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count at the end , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign shortly before the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
it will be exciting how vigor@@ ous newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ dless predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , ministers have got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is responsible for the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which probably will cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to Grand Masters ; Merkel Parliament election is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to hear no one from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign stands on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ te@@ bel , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that you are on the ground breaking the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Elec@@ tor Kok@@ en@@ an on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and largely reloc@@ ate their campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; states the pres@@ idents of Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other than that , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on searching for the local vocal ch@@ ords among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffering from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything pretty cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; explains El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
at the beginning of the week the construction site could be moved to the south as planned , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the receipt of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised , for instance when it comes to the establishment of temporary expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the passing traffic through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the over@@ haul management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were in residence in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded an ampli@@ fication of the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself clear on the spot .
two to three per minute have been s@@ lit .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the street is open again for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue break@@ downs let everyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the renovation has little consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but he also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel documents are missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales losses at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road painting threw its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his co @-@ workers have to let him go .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has replied to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the notice that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something has been handled more gener@@ ously .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
the fact that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t get around , it is also very nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his root @-@ client@@ ele returns to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , it &apos;s already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly in the name of fighting terrorism we are bol@@ ted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a dump@@ ing state to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the recycl@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also jeal@@ ous of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has allowed a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , rus@@ hed : that a new security agency is supposed to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor does the fact that Germany have to implement several EU rules on air passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he still keeps it reasonable and doesn &apos;t require anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them are in part : he plans quick methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted specifically in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of divor@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably delicate .
some of these have also been un@@ resolved and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees .
and things that people deeply occupied could not be cl@@ ung out in election campaign times .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ gan@@ ger quar@@ rel over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not make sense to re@@ open it .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of stuff that could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently trying to distinguish itself from the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes his willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor does Volkswagen come through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , ex@@ tradition numbers increase worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen launches in the second half of the year with its deliveries .
despite the diesel generation , Europe &apos;s largest automobile manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of the diesel generation thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW decreased particularly in Western Europe and thus again poll@@ uted the total sales , as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 per cent below the previous year &apos;s level .
deliveries in the home market of Germany dropped by almost one sixth .
chief of brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also bur@@ dened by the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas @-@ atmosphere first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to suffer from the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust qu@@ ests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate from the automobile , the customer does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my research commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after retro@@ fitting and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , customers come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important in the interest of customers to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay pen@@ al for their as@@ par@@ agus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is calling for this fee from retail and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on checking or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now he has covered 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cost 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost will now continue .
leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had hit head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with criminal off@@ ences for deposits of three million Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , but the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she is paying for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known as other banks that calculate a reimbur@@ sement rate for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love records .
before hur@@ rying to the comment section , to def@@ use it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ inity of men of intermedi@@ ary with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after age 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance : older dr@@ ink@@ ers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild@@ ly before I stop , keep my hands and say something contempl@@ ative like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still is a handful of fantastic plate @-@ specialty stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of Number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of Number : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media owner , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of fans of the record revision of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers imp@@ acted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone envel@@ opes , from objects that evo@@ ke happy ju@@ g@@ gling memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is a collector for me and I think it is so with a lot of people .
it &apos;s a simple way to focus mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff member beg@@ s from a stack of boards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ ked through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Number : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are young people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted nearly a whole floor to the records , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the psychological trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting plat@@ ens is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression of dar@@ ing pants pants pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record @-@ art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist , which exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with bum@@ ble@@ bees through plat@@ ters of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ving look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who stands above the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects an offer on demoli@@ shing shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , produce hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need .
a L@@ ille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people conducting 72 provisional trading , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide calm re@@ union between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable children un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to uph@@ old the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearances in the Olympic time , Rad@@ mund@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases start @-@ up for live video players
watching other people watching video games is a giant - that &apos;s what Microsoft wants to benefit from .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up event , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard playing field launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up staff , which is based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced .
for the customer , nothing is to be changed by the tak@@ eover .
according to Microsoft Be@@ am is integrated into the video player department around the Xbox console .
the market of live streaming video activity is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are being tested which are intended to effectively transfer speed .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the Vit@@ ronic Company from Wiesbaden can for example be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed police there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary speed camera .
but a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
in order to ensure that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way disappear without a sweat resistant outer she@@ ath .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the substantial defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but independently of this Fi@@ ji would have beaten a team of 15 men in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for Britain - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of G@@ Bs in fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au prevailed in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a prot@@ rac@@ ted T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute sh@@ em@@ al@@ ua was in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ play and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ eans whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the finishing touch with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged themselves and GB ki@@ cked up destroyed in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain was squee@@ zing South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ inal gold as with these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was there when she ru@@ ined the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ skilled deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al march .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and no one was helpful than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning something more than usual , trying to deal with his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called for &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years of exemplary clarity provided for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small French drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken stran@@ gl@@ ed the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who has been a member of the association for 31 years , has served as managing director for the past 28 years .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and villages .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler set up as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Ken@@ nel Board in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , fees and contributions to emergency calls on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the new water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and there was always new additions because water is food and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she engaged Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he regularly lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler in his turn praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well construction and restructuring of the association as highlights from his point of view .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the tu@@ bing in the high container near Kirch@@ hoff on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of new brun@@ n because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and wounded her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called upon us and declared his life partner to be shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be punished .
meanwhile Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man shall not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is supposed to call .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information on the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delic@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light prospects for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of euros .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity generation are from the table .
the German Steel Industry Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) in the release of the renewable energy layer in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , they fall into an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the reform of the emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to exac@@ erb@@ ate the situation when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies with price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have rather stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual plants .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the crowd went back for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : sing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular meetings allow sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also taken Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; speaking out and organizing , being able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
he who regularly asks his lungs doesn &apos;t get out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life too .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association for sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations common singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs with older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers are dec@@ lining themselves to long @-@ lying events .
while singing , the head also requires special performance , L@@ enz explains .
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are not only able to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , he advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with internet research .
those who like to sing should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats are more sensitive than boys on the scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males get cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need .
altogether nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited kit@@ ties that were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to the loudspeaker when the calls of the very excited kit@@ ten played .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ mental to sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to inf@@ ant no@@ ises in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski interfer@@ es with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
ahead of the du@@ el of Arch@@ riv@@ als between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : business as usual is announced .
already with the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
this will not stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
according to this , the South African living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency , initially suspended for 90 days , is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night @-@ night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the whole country , sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
in Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will arrive in particular on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
Cologne presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season ap@@ pers as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig put the base on the 14th title .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez borrow@@ ed from the AC Florence and annex@@ ed to Bes@@ ik@@ tas were announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club manager Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce around a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We cannot pay his salary in Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was banned twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing block@@ age had su@@ ed her starting right shortly before the games , was pi@@ ped off mer@@ cil@@ essly with her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
she had a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : she was still in the hall with an open smile and provoked her performance .
when it was discovered that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience collap@@ sed into a storm of rejo@@ icing .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already closed for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even runs faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the largest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after the pain was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European champi@@ onships , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the vi@@ cious capture and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and locked 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been bl@@ amed , mar@@ red Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world so far .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has received so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic gold in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games declined due to a verdict of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , clu@@ es were found on taking a forbidden nutritional supplement , the ban of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA deterior@@ ated and ran off on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens , be still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two blast sets went up again , according to the authorities , another human being killed .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular for tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive set had gone into the air in a flower order in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called for several wounded in the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves with possible motives , but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by enemies of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received secret references to im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they do not address tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and the Muslim population , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this grants the military great influence over the coming years as well .
Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister , Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 , after a period of bloody ri@@ ots , is committed to restoring the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to get a grip on Muslim rebels struggling for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also put the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Compl@@ aint Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultural &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - already observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the State Off@@ ices .
&quot; groups like the &quot; identical movement &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ az@@ ate said that he did not have any findings .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes more extreme .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a control influence over the party .
this is not apparent .
with a view to the substantial increase in rights campaig@@ ning crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism .
but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ ght@@ less structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying phenomenon .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ ges had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the righ@@ tist scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminals who had previously had nothing to reconci@@ le with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which have then radic@@ alised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or World Records decide the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ u at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ ash became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 year old participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more well @-@ known in under@@ represented countries .
because in the field of orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs most sports@@ men run , gre@@ ed just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media referred to him as the &quot; rocker of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump does not look so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an Altern@@ ati@@ vide@@ e .
he then drives on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; in the end , it will either work or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he described US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post will also want to offer their electric transpor@@ ters on the open market next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always surveys , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon join the mass production of vehicles .
in post @-@ owned production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete change to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .

GF@@ RP lead after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the feedback came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K indicated that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the worldwide number Five of the industry faces a new start .
Gf@@ K Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as 1 September , the management of the Board of Management will take over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ j@@ inger , and announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will continue to lead the market research company in the future is unclear at this time .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment over the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder at some point becomes rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue was 6.@@ 1 percent lower than in the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
relative to the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter mainly affected the company &apos;s s@@ unken asset in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the group sales of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros on the line .
the Gf@@ K generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
at an accident of a bus with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
according to information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t according to the indications , which drove partly on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory .
the bus desc@@ ended right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to sign up to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the Land Grab@@ bing Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach concluded that for@@ c@@ ements are running for these sewage installations .
due to legal principles , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ binding basis .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new calculation of the fees for sewage treatment plants in the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period must also be compensated .
due to the gra@@ cious rise of fees , Schmidt explained that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for the necessary repar@@ ations of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , all three plants have fallen to a considerable extent not least due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
in the world &apos;s pumping station , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be dischar@@ ged , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great maintenance costs in wastewater facilities , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , as one cannot extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal wastewater association in order not to bro@@ aden these facilities because it concerns defic@@ its .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. , monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the inflation rate in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remain as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , it allows for around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Licht@@ en@@ stein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ unted , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all faults will be opened to the public .
snap@@ sho@@ ot@@ ers have cast criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would propag@@ ate black face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when there was a filter this week , which gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow haw@@ k . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat confirmed that it would have turned off the feature .
the company provided an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mild to say &quot; was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face was drawn into the descending extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per river .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older counter@@ players - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat without reply .
the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu on their part said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military service fake IS@@ IS secret service information , re@@ jects Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the army committee , intelligence committees and military budget committee reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command sec@@ rec@@ y analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , near Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information that was typically gen@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com rank up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were much more positive than facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliated publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was exc@@ essively little space for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts as to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investig@@ ators of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the inter@@ activity of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , auth@@ ored a document on how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s declarations of air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. is winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will go a little longer to the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
whatever the game may start on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey s@@ layer in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we can rip the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand stop .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
surrounded by the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the wrist to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympics .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it has been so annoying for the last 16 years that many of those who I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who are for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend the gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of its never ending impact - but also the gra@@ c@@ efulness of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports , which essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympic dream .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .

a forward movement is not the goal .

there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .

&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at shot change .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ attered the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Africa International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive as much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the desert @-@ sides of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ si@@ ghted choice last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of t@@ inc@@ ture under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered so to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ered , who come from Ethiopia mostly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ sei , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that too does change .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ sei .
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ sei have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections , which according to the data of the analy@@ st apparently ple@@ ated by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian town , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she has recently announced that she has closed this base .
while the West un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally wants to support democracy , it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fear@@ ing that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication capacities of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly with the American public .
it also ent@@ ails his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who try to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of having to declare asser@@ tions which he could not have meant at all .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump reas@@ oned in terms of the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to imp@@ ly that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr Tr@@ ump wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Tr@@ ump as he attempted to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump again tried to return to this subject .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he declared &quot; Of course I thought it sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive sound , since his survey values have gone far@@ ther .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally not trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often critic@@ ises his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand with him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend the candidate from Thursday today in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani commented on the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her back@@ bul@@ kers , completely false , and that is why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of le@@ aning on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a damaged cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
the store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which bought the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people saw it as the last loss in a self @-@ gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it is also re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of stuff .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ c@@ aded onions .
there are nature rice dishes .
the café doesn &apos;t serve any beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has recently been such a customer on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb closed , she gave up coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual forced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and faithful customer .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has presented them soon , so that his new neighbors can feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and setting a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming felt .
&quot; I needed to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es latest book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ vol@@ ous snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ ney , this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Ziegel@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a little cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country strug@@ gl@@ ed with it no longer to be the land of milk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole itself as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ unite food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the central focus of American cuisine for years , became a seldom ser@@ ene luxury .
odd bl@@ ends were tried out , because a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome kitchen sense .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , bricks were made from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suited to each other .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - addressed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household leaders &quot; and the challenge of turning pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude .
while publicly pra@@ ising the simple I@@ owa Far@@ mer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ fic to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes led by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting dishes . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Ziegel@@ man , &quot; as well as on how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly into the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly it did not ta@@ sted bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dealt his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to get first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian prot@@ ector , showing him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God will see a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in the winter .
after an investigation aboard the ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms lei@@ surely on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Green@@ land@@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long that Greenland would become stone .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to watch , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s arks .
they measured their slow motion when they used to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cad@@ a@@ vers who descend from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ arks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cm measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ cs of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye @-@ lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remark@@ ably high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s when atomic weapons prevented greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the third smallest animal of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ de nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in its l@@ enti@@ core , all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ un@@ ts , however , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ing@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks can be evi@@ dently at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such met@@ e@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently goes to low @-@ consumption flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume increases much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of Ele@@ phant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
with topics relating to building , the Municipal Council has focused primarily on the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and access issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on measurement , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors .
as it was said , construction licenses can now be reported in the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to consult the municipal council in its September session .
in order to request further en@@ quiries about the res@@ ett@@ lement of further business enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the field of Unter@@ dat@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already developed there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the International Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary aggregates will continue to operate in London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK so far .
that is why we are using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lobby association reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the venture ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg sp@@ ends a large fund industry , it also makes it worse for the infrastructure in the infrastructure sector .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points are the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the Consulting Merc@@ er , the city ranked 7th , Luxemburg on No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at the 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead acqu@@ ires legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation install@@ ment amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two mer@@ ck patents associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ l and other il@@ lic@@ it acts .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the costs arising during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to work with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck co @-@ accused each other and took ownership of laboratory work , including sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
United States supported troops say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
supported by the United States , troops have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ating after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters that have been buried within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ let Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS alli@@ ed Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we &apos;re just taking up cleaning jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the democr@@ ats of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton globe donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ariums ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Kaiser of Virginia , published his tax declarations for the past ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Kaiser continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump conc@@ eals behind false exc@@ uses and trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax investigation by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the release of the Republi@@ can candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before the tax audi@@ ts are not finished .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential candidate did in the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , called Tr@@ ump into a meeting to share their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also under@@ gone a control examination of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that it was only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ill@@ ers .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , intensified its promotion along with the U.S. nature protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crop without viol@@ ating animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the World Day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition cord .
when lit , the con@@ dom crashes with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chim@@ e pow@@ ders in the air .
a breath is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er , which sho@@ ots a blast furnace into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
town council unanim@@ ously decides : no construction of a ki@@ osk at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and an - especially the retail trade in the core town is clearly ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ated .
however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the motion for the new construction of a sales office on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine @-@ Baltic region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed position on the bank of the Rhine , this news@@ stand does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots enth@@ r@@ alled a media clock after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s country code list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
following an explanation , the director went to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel manager said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels Management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ selection is cleared &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ bla@@ det made this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were app@@ alled and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response to the Internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have yiel@@ ded the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police op@@ poses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers attempted to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the governor of the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the activists saw Gra@@ ffi@@ tis spra@@ ying against the temporary President Michel Tim@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest on Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly , the ambassador shared with him .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing relations with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian representation was about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all Vis@@ as , of Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y assault on Thursday evening has been carried out at the Be@@ we XXL drink market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ hu@@ ed their faces , took the hand@@ over of cash out of the bar &apos;s employee and then first walked on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured doesn &apos;t share the police .
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly viewed from the car park of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid on Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , the perpetr@@ ators must be scanned and fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the parking house entrance with the silver colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of action ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun in summer free time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the socio @-@ educational day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers on their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the seclu@@ ded leisure pool Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first school holiday week .
several day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special nur@@ sery in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and super@@ vis@@ ors were treated with their self @-@ prepared body@@ boards such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops have been made to create beautiful gem@@ s made of beads and stones or a Roman @-@ mill game made of wood .
further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of departure the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned to their home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to the Rom@@ ero regi@@ stran@@ t in two years , the Council of Ministers has decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made for the Bishop of Freiburg , where a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 So Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the Holy One , set themselves in the way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage crosses and informed the pilgri@@ m .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by rail to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is started to sing along field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song of specially created pilgri@@ m song .
parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were responsible for a tasty and wholes@@ ome dinner and the breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next step was the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at Freiburg Min@@ ster later in the afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
the min@@ is of co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor stre@@ ak , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ unc@@ e@@ and made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they had only a modest sixth place at the London Under@@ ground World Championships despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a hin@@ der .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now developed .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner put an olymp@@ ic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the gold with gold .
Hin@@ du just came back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that desc@@ ended in a higher gear to slow it down , and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they got on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an olymp@@ ic board at the final round and the World Champion defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph at Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , there was evidence that after a weak start he deliberately fell on track .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like all the UK flags on the podium like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ uta , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int race , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy it for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record in London in 2012 lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had disputed yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a number of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing preparations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first night of the competition in Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached the perfect moment its climax , will be repeated again .
future of the melting plant of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract
the future of the aluminum sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision at Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed in the event of a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , as the enam@@ el consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley informed that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual plan amounting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt &quot; is not impaired .
the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into effect from November this year even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of bad economic conditions in the sector before the possible closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a carto@@ on reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
revealing the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sponsored reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and in the presence of the universally popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ om &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating about the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is for Vog@@ ue the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still leak@@ y prior to the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover are Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in the last few years there were more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like modelling &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but going around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Centr@@ es assign 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid stations are rejected annually by the municipal tax centres , while the sector is focused on the effects of further reductions on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - with their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the Director of the Regional Centr@@ es of Fri@@ esland , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the aboli@@ tion of the German government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Community Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ law@@ fully - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these abbrevi@@ ations so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers &quot; communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after employee re@@ port@@ edly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ activity after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina took a fire@@ arm on one employee in February while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a statement filed on Wednesday by the Land Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i tried to have been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his accus@@ ation .
after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date triggered a rebellion , when he claimed a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms bud@@ dies - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be chosen and appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ ance complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before country elections : losing the SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U stand out .
this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely reign in the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to pose the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just below the CD@@ U , which could again rise to 23 per cent .
third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still lag@@ ged behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left by 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time at 14 percent .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a pound and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would last for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the shops exactly 20 years ago - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they somehow come from the quar@@ ry of the internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could set a lot for those standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , though slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates the market , which all came much later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion units have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units are sold .
sales worldwide are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
the Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look .
she finally van@@ ished , Black@@ Berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks on his mobile 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put the smartphone away again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff in the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics took great advantage for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will lie wrong with He@@ ath@@ row as well .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport and the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lock@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads in the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of hate @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o battle between the anti @-@ clock@@ wise Open Source Community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has interven@@ ed in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile phone advertisement accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks .
as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared it .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook is worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences Pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over the ads on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just blocks would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not constitute a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesperson on an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent agent , which is why we concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to get more control into the hands of the people .
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday during a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles crossed on a motorway .
the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 who was trying to kill several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who call it as well as any witness of the incident , told us to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - involving a person in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was said in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent murder after she over@@ took and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the judgment .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ro@@ de into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should notify the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have previously identified Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists .
although presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans are evapor@@ ating and their water vap@@ or has been blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen left , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination rights in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternative president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he took the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employment struggles for the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil Field Service Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company provide the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dischar@@ ged thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision by the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star collar of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the star collar to different rates and in which context the rotation periods are associated with planetary creation .
&quot; we hope we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they are now spinning the quick@@ est .
at peak rotation rates these stra@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star @-@ win@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star collar of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
he signed a ten @-@ year contract with 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players are showing similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is its occurrence outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2009 , the super@@ star had admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , forbidden ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I have played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends hit the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , got married to the relationship with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy @-@ expressions of the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the cri@@ tically acclaimed athle@@ tics cont@@ ests these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Women Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation between the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Women &apos;s Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread across the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B rehear@@ sal should also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v informed him immediately with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ poll@@ uted nation must not take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team from the start to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the course of the swimming sport , the previous shipments in China ensured fierce confron@@ tations also between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of an argument with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese nation@@ als for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers squee@@ ze their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims readily paid the redemption money required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators increasingly special@@ ise in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the world .
in 2008 , most of the malware programmes were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is therefore higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will reg@@ ain their data .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , direct access to accessible support sites or en@@ code sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed by a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits were created by the malware , giving advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of supply is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service business .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per authenti@@ cated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be managed by file back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful education , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat linked to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the interior materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with folded back rests available , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded easily , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to do something more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( working at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and throt@@ tles the speed when required .
but full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI connectors are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage treatment plant which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was so poor - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs were not successful in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the plain@@ ti@@ ff was left .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
in other words , he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , said many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals up to the federal elections in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ scale four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the ar@@ mis@@ tice should be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult .
the most recently discussed duty of silence for physicians is supposed to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on full @-@ wear is problematic constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject wearing the Bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate energy and manoeu@@ v@@ r@@ ability with ever new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet spra@@ ins and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the law of law is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic at the surroundings of the road every evening when driving over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the following Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then jump right from the Hammer Road to the right .
the major advantage is that the traffic is mutually beneficial , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Church of Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder is especially annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return @-@ state extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go Way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only a single trace along the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge did not have the necessary load capacity to record the heavy duty transport in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected work@@ station is going to last will not be able to say the responsible state operation .
however it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining service life until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal process , the state enterprise deliberately chose the traffic weaker time during school holidays because it could be expected with disabilities .
traffic is tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are planning a musical project .
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Woo@@ den School Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the prize @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students visited the Small House between 11 and 15 years .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of youth with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster within the framework of this project .
most of the young people in the class had come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
between October and December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen fighter in the southwest of Germany on the night for Friday a stroke of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain , to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
star@@ ters are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their names , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips against Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning long before the alarm bells are no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
at least one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing .
what are sleeping problems or sleeping problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Dec@@ eption and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
however , what one understands temporarily , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ let and sleep disorder .
especially when sleeping , many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board at the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , every two to three hours w@@ akes up and starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , you &apos;ll get an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you go to the doctor with in@@ som@@ nia ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advise you .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ finished , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any dis@@ continued sleep physician in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should first contact the doctor in case of sleep problems , she advis@@ es .
it can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the bedroom laboratory , and what is happening ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ers , for sick day fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the disgu@@ ise one goes to bed during his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ g@@ les , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
a camera is also featured on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep .
watch out : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s absolutely not con@@ duci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook as a dis@@ ap@@ pointing out@@ crop of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the short @-@ world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler presented himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates in the cri@@ tique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls on the election Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de arrested by Bag@@ gage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the police prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport saw a gang known to the polic@@ emen from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were involved in a community , socially and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , which have been submitted to Germany for off@@ ences .
in the process , they had a total of over 15,000 EUR .
old buildings , some lime trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police numbers them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a refres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down very soon , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , however , article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy city district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is preferred by burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself in favour of a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who mainly attracts three children , are above all anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who mostly wished for police protection from the other left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also today has a low average income and a high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under large police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ators from around the world : with them residents of the GDR times and former domestic occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can recognize them on s@@ wind@@ led discs or freshly painted facades , which were raised with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes like body injury depend almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences cause damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the controversial 94 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the streets and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and stayed .
that is why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : with fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building blocks , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so poll@@ uted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for people who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the neighborhood .
those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub , can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new representative for refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group for refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else interven@@ es .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wool mel@@ ee , which mainly has a problem .
some - less ridi@@ cu@@ le than on the multitude of requests for tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative competence with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ ving wool @-@ cow .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has fixed a 50 percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not possible to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not done with apartments .
prospect is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so , administration and volunteers also jump here .
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time appropriately , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling at some point , can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk may and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must look out locally and in the region by activities .
they always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics elu@@ des itself .
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been fully utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der wanted with helicopter
