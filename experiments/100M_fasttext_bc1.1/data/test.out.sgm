<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they chased home to the forages in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended already again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe presented the "Golden Sportpyramid" to the man from Anhausen within the framework of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman does not lack accolades.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="21">Langer has been supporting young children for decades.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those doubts small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive regulations massive, and he's strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "on the other hand, Clinton said:" "" "the state must fulfill certain tasks, it has opportunities to open up and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the meantime, Trump and Clinton had to be invested in almost word-to-word.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate foresees the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are traditional democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions at Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazical trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the US does not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example, Clinton calls for.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage must be up, then he says that he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>

<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the president of Condrobs, a supporter of social welfare services in Bavaria, and among other things deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the setup together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "women outweigh other reasons for escape:" "" "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, slavery or forced prostitution in their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, tugs for a bottle of water require a sexual act, is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany, Bahr tells us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior or abused in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they dare not speak openly about the experience because shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodations only for them, Bahr requests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District Governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there is no such thing in accommodation of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabians alone escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken, there are floors in some common shelters or houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "also the committee" "" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="46">Above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy Members have called upon their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterparty in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared clumsy and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if anything bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's outshining, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "Putin negotiated and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Going on was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the vex is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media made a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after last month at a failed coup d'etat of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tour operators and charter companies will be relieved in Russia when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television announced cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persistent resentment goes beyond the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected bodies after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-understood for Moscow that even a deep-seated fear of regime changes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this dazzling palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel ill-treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents told at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress that.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of the strictest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special commissioner for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that without stating grounds Putin has ordered" "" "the discharge of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy to Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it reads (in Russian) that he later was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the governing body.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the main task of the government to support your work as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he is working for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entrust a complaint for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov to be one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally, Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "deckfittings" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 inclined ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said:" "" "the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens say: investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD suggests a" "" "living concept" "" "at the next meeting session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it's about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a settlement is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is, as Bratmann said:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, he said:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few precepts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "no matter how viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is failing." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now buy outgoing bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in Weststadt there are deadlines at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not mean the owners, the housing estate companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will be some movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke believes:" "" "the CDU must go into the boat for a broad majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer spending their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and last to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest was falling in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand overburdened by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and as soon as they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person refuted each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of subsequent folks, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take" 30 minutes time, "" come from the sofa "and" be active every day, "appeals to deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mowing game spoilers, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made itself a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even when Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit have already been able to track our activity earlier, they did not give us any reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Based on Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all that immun.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Across the line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast laughed on Thursday for a multi-campaign title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women of Simone Biles tower on the balance beam during the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics of the Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multiple battle title and the fifth, while she reinforces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals, winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics of the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired Chief Coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit into the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has not lost any more competition, a winning series that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was guided by two turns, the picture dwindled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating Beams and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the world title - lurks.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and put on top of it with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently when she awaited her end - a mere formality - and tears poured out on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision they once described in her collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team of men, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground exercise they cast a comeback to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the fast spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympianism in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, who is Roman Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female gymnasts was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual fight for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the pinnacle of this kind of sport, but we do not see sports classes anywhere in the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same road as Aly and Madison to bring it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four turnerships in the team. furthermore, the last year Marta Karolyi is a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like gymnastics are an expensive sport, and Turner primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued at will.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the congregations innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to get interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Hole of the Olympic team and thank you for starting their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 resident doctors, who voted in favour of election, rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans to introduce the treaty in force and said that the NHS would be in a "No Man's Land" and would be detrimental to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants should receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend serendars in order to improve care for hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance doctors announced last night in a communication with: "assistence doctors have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current crisis of staff and will cut it up to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through talks met with the government for reluctance and sometimes on a deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt made last month about that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, raise the vibration and address the worries of assistance doctors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do so, the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to have a better weekday pay for the 54.000 assistant doctors, who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS employees, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "labor battle measures reach nothing of only little, but strain already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nurses and their families only worries, distress and interruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past two months we have talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the tutelage and the whistle-busting with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who were returning from a professional time, training courses, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was employers who were health education UK and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread voting in Muslim communities as a crushing governmental report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and city councils to have ignored evidence of electoral misuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">He recommends that voters need to demonstrate their identity in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter merely has to name its name and address.</seg>

<seg id="9">Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and fraud culture associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special tribunal decided that the reigning mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person as someone else chooses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed in particular alarmingly to the fraudulent postal vote - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading expressions to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or bangian background.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself with Krav Maga against weapons attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approached from behind you should turn around first, so that you can see your aggressor and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with his knees in the body and twist, while the attacker crumbles from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the assailant on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and straightening the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it works in Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler cancels his immune system and sausages in a serious test by leaching some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabbled his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a pull-out button on a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before staining each object, he used a luminaire to show himself and us what he is going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Likhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to check the rinsing button of a pull toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling around the world and eating odd and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to flush links of toilets, the task put its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test screed showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminaires were over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Likhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutiny than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't wake up here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Likhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstormings, which ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things that I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to Ian to put them in and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty marks on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and their partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">When they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were gaping holes, wooden boards were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who worked for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>

<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as delogization is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the congregation who have gracefully approached us and have given us the information they have provided.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: the natives receive nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is not so stupid as to date: summer holidays, heat and land baldness - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count at the end, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign shortly before the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting how vigorous newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create that" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which probably will cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to Grand Masters; Merkel Parliament election is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other states" "", "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Apart from that, the north-east CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, says Koktebel, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into parliament.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Restoration: restaurants suffering from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty crunchy," explains Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the week the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The receipt of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised, for instance when it comes to the establishment of temporary expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The passing traffic through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the overhaul management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were in residence in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded an amplification of the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself clear on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been slit.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 hourly kilometres in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue breakdowns let everyone look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has little consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "at most slight decline" "", "but he also admits that" "" "the travel documents are missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the local restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "he estimates the sales losses at" "" "over 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road painting threw its operation" "" "thrown back for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his co-workers have to let him go.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has replied to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the notice that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fact that other regulars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get around, it is also very nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his root-clientele returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, it's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "this will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "said the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But he still keeps it reasonable and doesn't require anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are in part: he plans quick methods for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted specifically in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of divorce for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally inextricably delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of these have also been unresolved and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply occupied could not be clung out in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The focus is on inner security.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before hurrying to the comment section, to defuse it under the pseudonym non-allinity of men of intermediary with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after age 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance: older drinkers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffed wildly before I stop, keep my hands and say something contemplative like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still is a handful of fantastic plate-specialty stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, of Sister Ray (Number of Number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of Number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I thought was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media owner, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers impacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gramophone envelopes, from objects that evoke happy juggling memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a collector for me and I think it is so with a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to focus mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff member begs from a stack of boards." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoked through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are young people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted nearly a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the newest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the psychological traumas are hard to detectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting platens is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression of daring pants pants pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record-art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist, which exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with bumblebees through platters of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who stands above the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, produce hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting 72 provisional trading, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide calm reunion between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable children unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to uphold the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it said that the closure would be" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor: in different federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested which are intended to effectively transfer speed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from the Vitronic Company from Wiesbaden can for example be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at highway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed police there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary speed camera.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days for uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the state-of-the-art state, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to ensure that it is not simply stowed, it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way disappear without a sweat resistant outer sheath.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby reached an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The substantial defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this Fiji would have beaten a team of 15 men in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for Britain - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of GBs in fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau prevailed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A protracted Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute shemalua was in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Seeinsuleans whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the finishing touch with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked up destroyed in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated in the semifinals of 20-5 and Britain was squeezing South Africa in a scarce semi-finalist match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold as with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was there when she ruined the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unskilled deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal march.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers that make the difference and no one was helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-raising morning something more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was a Captain at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called for "lead in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that was my last race.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitensteingruppe was" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who has been a member of the association for 31 years, has served as managing director for the past 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller set up as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Kennel Board in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, fees and contributions to emergency calls on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new well (1994), purchase of land in the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the redevelopment of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the new water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill and there was always new additions because water is food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she engaged Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he regularly lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Unterfranken district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller in his turn praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">He described the well construction and restructuring of the association as highlights from his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the tubing in the high container near Kirchhoff on January 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of new brunn because one filled the elevated tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity generation are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Steel Industry Minister, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) in the release of the renewable energy layer in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, they fall into an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate the situation when the world's largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies with price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have rather stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Division announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the crowd went back for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: sing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular meetings allow seniors to socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also taken Ursel Kipp in her choir: "speaking out and organizing, being able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">He who regularly asks his lungs doesn't get out of the puff in everyday life too.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association for seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs with older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers are declining themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, the head also requires special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are not only able to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, he advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who like to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover, which effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the mistrust also did not let the males get cold - however, they always remained the same in contrast to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of regression of cat babys at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were played for a herd of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kitties that were raised in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "all the females, even those who had no offspring, responded differently to the screams," "" "said Konerding." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "" "said the biologist." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to infant noises in humans.</seg>

<seg id="8">When it was discovered that it won't get gold, the audience collapsed into a storm of rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are numerous other sportsmen who go to the start despite the doping past at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): the 34-year-old belongs to the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already closed for doping twice (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-world champion even runs faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>

<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>

<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.10 euros as of October 1, 2016 for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welthahl 3,44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the Land Grabbing Office Kulmbach concluded that forcements are running for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost-binding basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens and the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welthahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented the panel, a new calculation of the fees for sewage treatment plants in the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period must also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to the gracious rise of fees, Schmidt explained that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for the necessary reparations of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, all three plants have fallen to a considerable extent not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welthahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the Azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the world's pumping station, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be discharged, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully smashed. "</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of great maintenance costs in wastewater facilities, has been spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the long run, as one cannot extend the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association in order not to broaden these facilities because it concerns deficits.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it allows for around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblunted, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All faults will be opened to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshooters have cast criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would propagate black face or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When there was a filter this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow hawk."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat confirmed that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was "hurtful and mild to say" was unpleasant. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face was drawn into the descending extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper river.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older counterplayers - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leaders and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat without reply.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu on their part said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments regarding ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "complained morals under analysts and" "" "there was excessively little space for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts as to a" "" "specific political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were taken up after complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigators of the General Inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the interactivity of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, authored a document on how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's declarations of air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these temporary refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commandlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S. is winning fourth match in the field hockey of women, showdown with Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will go a little longer to the strong Dutch, who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may start on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey slayer in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can rip the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back-hand stop.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US keeper, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surrounded by the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the wrist to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so annoying for the last 16 years that many of those who I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who are for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend the gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of its never ending impact - but also the gracefulness of gymnastics and diving, the two sports, which essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much like" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympic dream.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel more fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the getting and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his after air ringing, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot change.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shattered the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Africa International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert-sides of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-sighted choice last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of tincture under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orosei and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orosei and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas prospered, who come from Ethiopia mostly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Orosei, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too does change.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orosei have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such a turmoil was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections, which according to the data of the analyst apparently pleated by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersian town, managed by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she has recently announced that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West unequivocally wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fearing that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication capacities of the Republican Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails his fellow combatants who try to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to declare assertions which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump reasoned in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr Trump wanted to help mitigate the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Trump as he attempted to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he declared "Of course I thought it sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then recuperate as needed.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive sound, since his survey values have gone farther.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally not trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often criticises his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he reinforces the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand with him, regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, was struggling to defend the candidate from Thursday today in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "Mr. Giuliani commented on the correctness of Mr. Trumps' statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called her backbulkers, completely false, and that is why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of leaning on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps' excuse as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once crowded at the price of the market, Café is back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a damaged cafe in Williamsburg, in which one could only pay cash which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store Soap Cherie, which bought the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people saw it as the last loss in a self-gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it is also re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime associate of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of stuff.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and saucaded onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café doesn't serve any beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rebecca Oliveira has recently been such a customer on a Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual forced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and faithful customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal always gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we will go down to their offer," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he has presented them soon, so that his new neighbors can feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and setting a new coffee like a homecoming felt.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I needed to smell," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Coes latest book" "" "Chop Suey" "" "dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "" "" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective. "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frivolous snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackney, this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a little cheap which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "marks the roads with which the country struggled with it no longer to be the land of milk." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," "" "Coe said, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple food, the casserole itself as a "wonderful way to reunite food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the central focus of American cuisine for years, became a seldom serene luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd blends were tried out, because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholesome kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which includes recipes, bricks were made from this period, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular supplement at noon," Coe says.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not suited to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - addressed the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household leaders" and the challenge of turning pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historical delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Me-Cake-Essen-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa Farmer's kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and had a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terrific to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor urged him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, a housekeeper with no interest in tastes led by Mrs Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting dishes. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country came back on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, "Ziegelman," as well as on how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "brick was recalled:" "" "she really made people ill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the incident of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it's called Prune Whip," "" "said Ziegelman, and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">No whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each dipped something reluctantly into the tamed, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly it did not tasted bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE took three times a supplement.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "like a Can-Do-Budgetter, he said to his wife," "" "A few chopped walnuts would help." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation aboard the ship Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönlandshark swims leisurely on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenlandshark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected long that Greenland would become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's arks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they used to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers who descend from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-arks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lentics of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye-lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkably high carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s when atomic weapons prevented greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the third smallest animal of 220 centimeters, the lentide nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its lenticore, all major Greenland-haunts, however, had normal carbon-14 amounts produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Grönlandshark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandinghai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks can be evidently at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such metealemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently goes to low-consumption flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume increases much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran, the interest on Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly, the ambassador shared with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are adopting existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>

<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were handled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to the Romero registrant in two years, the Council of Ministers has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made for the Bishop of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the Holy Year of Mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 So Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greene, and Haigerloch, and the Holy One, set themselves in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and informed the pilgrim.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by rail to the starting point Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, each with a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis started to sing along field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially created pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish homes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for a tasty and wholesome dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next step was the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburg Minster later in the afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The minis of cooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor streak, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Junceand made the legend haughty when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they had only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner put an olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the gold with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu just came back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that descended in a higher gear to slow it down, and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic board at the final round and the World Champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoys side, there was evidence that after a weak start he deliberately fell on track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindu said:" "" "it feels like all the UK flags on the podium like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>

<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint race, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>

<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record in London in 2012 lay at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had disputed yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archives soon of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a number of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbing preparations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first night of the competition in Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached the perfect moment its climax, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby elevates all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision at Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 workstations -direct and indirect - could be jeopardised in the event of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect, as the enamel consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley informed that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into effect as of November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenues," "" "said the power supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual plan amounting to $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt" is not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into effect from November this year even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of bad economic conditions in the sector before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity a year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">Revealing the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), sponsored reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the universally popular show biz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have a surprise party planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendom's big sister Kim likes her beating about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still leaky prior to the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last few years there were more "celebrities who like modelling" as "models, celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners likes success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell pictures of their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is in reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a pound and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would last for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came into the shops exactly 20 years ago - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet, but they somehow come from the quarry of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the West pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could set a lot for those standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, though slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster, finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market dominates the market, which all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online always and everywhere is today for very many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion units have been sold, on Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million units are sold.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sales worldwide are around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had a look.</seg>

<seg id="36">The legends now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, it was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics took great advantage for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flocking on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will lie wrong with Heathrow as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hate-and-fro battle between the anti-clockwise Open Source Community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday during a presumed suicide of several vehicles crossed on a motorway.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have previously identified Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporating and their water vapor has been blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen left, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: as perfide, hackers squeeze their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Abwehr specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims readily paid the redemption money required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators increasingly specialise in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programmes were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is therefore higher if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will regain their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, direct access to accessible support sites or encode sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed by a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits were created by the malware, giving advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service business.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per authenticated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals employ spammers with dissemination" "", "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be managed by file back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful education, the perpetrators are threatening with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat linked to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded easily, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol engine will receive from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the law of law is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic at the surroundings of the road every evening when driving over the motorway from Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the following Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then jump right from the Hammer Road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage is that the traffic is mutually beneficial, thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Church of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road constriction on the feeder is especially annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return-state extends up to the bridge over the Albergo Way and sometimes also beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle's eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only a single trace along the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt in a good three-quarter years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge did not have the necessary load capacity to record the heavy duty transport in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the connected workstation is going to last will not be able to say the responsible state operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">However it has to be reckoned with years: the bridge has an official remaining service life until the year 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips against Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning long before the alarm bells are no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Deception and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what one understands temporarily, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inlet and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially when sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in depression," "" "said Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, every two to three hours wakes up and starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, you'll get an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to the doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advise you.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unfinished, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any discontinued sleep physician in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first contact the doctor in case of sleep problems, she advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the bedroom laboratory, and what is happening?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory physician, for example, in snoring with breathing replacers, for sick day fatigue, sleep converters or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disguise one goes to bed during his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera is also featured on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Watch out: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's absolutely not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who mainly attracts three children, are above all annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez who mostly wished for police protection from the other left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house occupants and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also today has a low average income and a high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Street close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under large police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and pollinators from around the world: with them residents of the GDR times and former domestic occupants share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can recognize them on swindled discs or freshly painted facades, which were raised with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes like body injury depend almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences cause damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the controversial 94 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the streets and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: with faceless newbuildings in former building blocks, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so polluted," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for people who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene were part of the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with the first names have asked not to be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new representative for refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else intervenes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving wool melee, which mainly has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less ridicule than on the multitude of requests for tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative competence with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a eiving wool-cow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has fixed a 50 percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not possible to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not done with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Prospect is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, administration and volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time appropriately, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling at some point, can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems," "" "said customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some naive might call." "" "a residual risk may and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must look out locally and in the region by activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics eludes itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been fully utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
