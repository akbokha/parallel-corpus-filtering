Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal raised by Obama for Iran &apos;s nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which had partly been rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this meeting with regard to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor tries to have his girlfriend shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home .
Lamb was very important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ bled upon a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call some@@ time later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and cow@@ or@@ kers who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ ent@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the wonderful people he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs after returning to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb fought with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson city of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail entered the summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for several companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the open and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took place on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the congregation .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l watch , while the University Choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot himself , and that Lamb in his emergency called Pr@@ ent@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire less workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us say that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , Christmas business is drawing near@@ er , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers in order to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox celebrates with Princess Diana on his &quot; date &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the greatest time @-@ travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon stated his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the UK and France - on the si@@ delines of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they have shown in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when poll@@ s down , it doesn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given guidance to the rising emergence of Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now seeing Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and starting to let their dollar flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac agreement in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio , with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first presidential nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they impose their v@@ ows , republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten believe that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a ple@@ th@@ ora of GO@@ P voters faces Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still strikes almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps health support .
ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have committed their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump had called immigrants from Mexico two months ago , the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse led to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation effort .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s up to new high levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a re@@ et@@ op house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular situations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really limited .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , one of the prices seems like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are sometimes tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here exceptionally .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
dou@@ bling Tor@@ ri@@ cher in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ ol@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deser@@ ved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
at his 28th place in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership Müller , Müller received the full help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ben Roberto , who caused a swe@@ pt of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich speaking word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud to be here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they cour@@ age@@ ously went to work in their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ously .
the attacks were often introduced to the left outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct charge , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians had used their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fers .
but on por@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er there was a discount .
so about as he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye on the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after finishing the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lei@@ feld , Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something different from it , it &apos;s malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game there was a crash in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ c had pro@@ voc@@ ed the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized one and proc@@ eeded with bat@@ ches against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in the event of ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , higher than 2.6 to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflammation in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , take ten years before the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non@@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Boeing discovered from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to a high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years is affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists find ruins from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s bank of the Rhine
arch@@ eological findings have been found on the right bank of the Rhine for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings excav@@ ated , Museum Director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a department of archaeological heritage preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists now found five .
from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which belonged to the church .

EU Commission to launch new court in conflict over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is set to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment .
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
this is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
so far , the proceeding participants agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström .
in the long term she wants to work on an International Investment Court according to his own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied there .
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to set compensation for tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national legislation or cut down consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this , was called it .
the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , there should be a framework for the agreement already at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ looking foli@@ age @-@ singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , about which his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative mis@@ chief .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to blend harmon@@ i@@ ously to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time into great opul@@ ent drift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states should be sung in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him and his guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
passing ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , however programmed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs desc@@ ended , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ band and large fluorescent stage dé@@ cor .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
until an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens would rather humble himself , play acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s request
since his election , Mr Cor@@ bes@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s request with suspen@@ se is expected
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is supposed to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s request and to work with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six set @-@ up questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the heart of several front@@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; been respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called for differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also &quot; stack &quot; within the Labour &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour MEPs have been propos@@ ing to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and reti@@ ring minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box across Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader who promised another policy approach states that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; punch skill &quot; and the quar@@ rels with resistance , and instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who is represented in the shadows of economic ministers , if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , spokes@@ man of the House of Comm@@ ons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the question was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound rose sharply by dates that indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid price SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , net income in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and raised estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded by an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking eover offer of Riv@@ tal AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and merge brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were up to 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - are again growing .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core grew 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports loan company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Ben@@ ding @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .

the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros difficult .

currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carl@@ ton .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 am the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you have I@@ dol , whose poster is hanging in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the Suite where the Canadian singer lives will cost the day exactly as much as her m@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory School duty ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the promotional break of Super@@ so he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and at every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects points .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber was in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at # 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least it does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of potato @-@ d@@ öner
potato or D@@ öner ?
both - in the potato @-@ d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a pe@@ gi@@ da poster , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile been registered at the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches campaign launch campaign to fight against ageing
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump onboard , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor Strate@@ gic Day .
there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five per cent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath at Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be opening 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and the high fixed cost base amounts to Met@@ cash could cost around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s turnover in the food and food business rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , which has been supplying about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at equal pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler continues and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to settle sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and re@@ hab tools to El@@ an are to be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and ear@@ ns a praise for his own behaviour after the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious argument with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka on the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat the kid , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a sei@@ z@@ ure sh@@ ook a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ro &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has made the climb very fast , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and sever@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
there was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants joined in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indignation .
the people fle@@ eing from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian Stand@@ ing Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ run Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the crisis of immigration on the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the gateway to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation arising from mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate people &apos;s data and squee@@ zed a crowd in order to get there .
about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton has continued to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ ander is ranked second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic constitu@@ ents say that it is too early to say that their opinion states which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a huge margin among women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men has declined mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders only have 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , however , has a huge margin ahead of the older voters .
last month Clinton was facing S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more strongly mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection to Clinton &apos;s Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be cited .
as the vice president raises potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ election are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clinton &apos;s followers more than half are saying that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure dropped from 78 percent last month .
bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; cho@@ ic@@ est &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ torate .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out unacceptable to these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
in general , democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ election also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being questioned during the term as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced by all .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of Americans are now un@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall views , although 36 percent said that their opinion had wor@@ sen@@ ed from it .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy , Clinton is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voting holders do not consider them to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however Clinton and Tr@@ ump are receiving good sheet music scores .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush perform best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democ@@ rat voters in the primary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is om@@ itted , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the bottom , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in surveys - with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tr@@ ump ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a Camp@@ aig@@ n in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go into the sea anymore : the water in the north and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , informs the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ l@@ ous ritual in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ lagen was filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood accessed Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call for the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year on the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise of interest is coming , and the Hanse@@ atic League will stag@@ ger , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process .
a recession came within 11 months of the first increase in interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was over@@ done because of interest rate increases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can be volati@@ le for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that property yields will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effects on shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return on stock begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP fell below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market players made a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate increases , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks , if they change their strategic direction .
in the case of bor@@ rowing , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / reduction occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment the bond @-@ endi@@ ces immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields closer together between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , even though &quot; we are cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tension increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and entire businesses , which handle the greater part of their business operations in the US , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
savers can see gains from higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Manager rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er must be worked on to engage the public as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element in BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to en@@ close the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from tax@@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales so@@ aked at slow@@ est pace in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the recordings started in 2000 .
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe Black Friday has bra@@ ked spending in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending on August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it is sw@@ inging and we may experience that the growth is less@@ ening .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that a little more than £ 1 was issued online from £ 5 .
some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , are now being carried out via web shops more than a third of the purchases .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia part of the collapse of the huge Saudi Arabian Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane fell
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead had their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed to the holy place , where only days before a building crane went through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then rus@@ hed to the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral when the Saudi king over the construction company of the bin Laden brought a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of the bin Laden , which also left 3@@ 94 .
the bodies of 29 wor@@ ship@@ pers who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also compl@@ ained the group because of the non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que is part of the massive construction project led by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eit@@ ful son , which was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has under@@ gone an increase in
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled host@@ esses who carry out the work in their home .
if you can be sk@@ il@@ fully b@@ yp@@ assed with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , it seems to be a minority nowadays .
the British employ increasingly skilled craftsmen to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , has now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to look at the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who carry more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .

officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and suspension training at the regional court K@@ lagen@@ furt .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with abuse of authority .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted on this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants used money from club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to function in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was eliminated by the Chair@@ person of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point in time the association had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials only had compensation charges and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : will we continue or ban the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , the chief financial officer in the bread @-@ profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ workers and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies as security have been laid down by the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the receipt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of financial success , the withdrawal of the compensation charges was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance would be paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
the former ob@@ s@@ man explained the proceedings as well as package and non @-@ detail amendments .
the accounts and pass@@ books managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial support , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against whom a function@@ ary investig@@ ates investigations into account of office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the functional man justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the officials said he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month for di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused were unable to present exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept , declared they were , after a test in which everything had been judged correctly .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
all the fixes had to be made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to drive to the Bank home to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard prints more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel cuts that have been running for three years , the computer will break down further jobs during the spl@@ itting up of the company .
the sta@@ ff@@ ing positions of the US @-@ computer Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
the company agreed on Tuesday to cut costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will start from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
in the previous year , Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard came in 2.3 percent .
the Pal@@ o Alto , which has become a large @-@ scale printer from California , is now split up : the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with spl@@ itting and massive recruitment of job changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the management of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently responded that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the breakdown of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would most likely be rejected : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent expressed their consent .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed say that 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IAA
the main focus of the fair is on September 27 , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday .
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA Car Association expect approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demoli@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break @-@ off at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it , a police line had been formed and a water@@ row@@ er stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially continued to include pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees bag@@ ged themselves together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Ser@@ b police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is watching when the US staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still the last week of the opinion that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and starting a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relationships .
it has warned the markets of hi@@ ring an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
letter of death at Delta State University left excuse
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could und@@ o it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , faculty for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot a man , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ss was named by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ en@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville at night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his lifestyle on the university &apos;s website .

the actor allegedly had to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone .
around 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and enhances the cheap price @-@ based Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more management board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings will be in charge of the executive board team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new generation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group will in future compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit in the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the strike on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with forec@@ asted record results , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit desires &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in yiel@@ ding results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa puts out routes to the Group &apos;s own equity line , Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United may not play for months due to double frac@@ ture
at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this made the left outer defender to cry and exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will last and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say an El@@ f@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
the UK Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championships in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sl@@ ump when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ ze &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - following a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental bill , which was published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is said to describe the story of the book , instead res@@ sources a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ urg@@ y , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he wants to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so familiar with the act of the book . here , an unknown boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by gre@@ edy , trees @-@ prone , thri@@ ving On@@ ce @-@ eag@@ les , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who hadn &apos;t read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circular bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ fall .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th out is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good ass@@ aults under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , if he hopes to get further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s especially a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test stroke is given to place his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton won nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I pre@@ tend to be high .
he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he finished 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he &apos;s a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred re@@ treats and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his stat@@ s on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the training staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game to bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could win Zul@@ u when the economy turns into a le@@ aching machine by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ dis@@ gor@@ ged ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ arians and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , as deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always full of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes an outside looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as for the exc@@ essively long persist@@ ence like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ alli@@ ble force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland leaving from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has gained nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they did during the referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ist , who took a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all its ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of Tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir fi@@ gured much about her , but noticed that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly t@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ 80 years , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I take it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blo@@ b dy@@ e tendency and the wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; An Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ ingly bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline is important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with her B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , her anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of on Monday by something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceedingly win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously informed by British American Tob@@ acco Pre@@ vention ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s public health references in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence until now that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by making clear evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ poin@@ ter , says former leader of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ poin@@ ter and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on commission or broadcast that are clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee during his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least apply his production to programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they are sending The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax would be financed which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ poin@@ ter is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this public @-@ legal television should be .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC are giving again what former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , you all think , we all think that one receives a big value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review their lithium mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fied the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion can@@ als and can be found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion can@@ als and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion can@@ als .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn neur@@ ons on and off with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that he could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ onic waves can happen without hin@@ dran@@ ce and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and metro trains , requiring a second look .
&quot; important notice : go from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .

the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum für cruel Designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 @-@ pack of Allen keys maintained that &quot; gain access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ o@@ dy advertisements produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters greet commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertisements for the weapons fair - through a lease of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , sh@@ ady company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with the blu@@ epr@@ ints of bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is an action of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade show comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors inv@@ ent fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ handed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from easy nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell where you are , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bat@@ ons , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , boys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like contrary to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people go .
people often transform themselves into drinks reception , film nights and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress up and decorate their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship with the university
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that can be friendly and social and lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away to keep the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the pinn@@ acle of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than greeting the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of mil@@ let for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy , but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the letter you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before letting her own music upset , closed her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take her away , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she with@@ drew all mutual friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the border between an el@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not cr@@ unch their possessions on the ceiling any more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single travellers , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the ear@@ ner mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms does not have any sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row house needs very little space .
it facilitates integration .
it &apos;s different if you put people in your home blocks .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ gal : I have correctly gone through my project .
this complic@@ ates the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ha value of special construction and the regulation regulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
guil@@ d : true , we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling you that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update fails &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create room - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update , and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is finished .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup runner pointed out ahead of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before the post @-@ race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve rounds of the season and also took the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
a Dun@@ st@@ glo@@ cke has been hanging over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red &amp; White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly centre Anton@@ gi@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
apart from consultations one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain into the inner city .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
from now on , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently many services of the insur@@ ances are not used , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ gi@@ ft and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly reflected in the demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the opening fes@@ tivities , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the reconciliation in old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the social foundation supports a large contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the lod@@ g@@ ings office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ang gives the Künstler@@ haus an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was the name of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after World War II .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg Palace and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med by the business , insul@@ ted the government , and repro@@ ached her with the fake money in front of her feet , as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper had reported .
the Bremen City confirms the alleg@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was on the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and bleeding heavily out of his nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the temple , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male .
with the aid of a stroke , one applied to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue bag description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and indications to report on the telephone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
furthermore , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ kel Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ r@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds his successor in the coming months with half a passage to the page .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met for years Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of pursuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also seems to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical officer in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness in Neu@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and require a room for speaking .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 Euros will receive the mill@@ er as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another house doctor practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice survey by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone too .
by the way , whoever visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s office , also looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field staff .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ended , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little melanch@@ oly after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to submit an asylum claim can &quot; naturally &quot; do so .
the focus is on the care and safety of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to reduce its borders for refugees but not factories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been continually meeting in the Croatian ts@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country had some 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people were wise to suggest certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , further bus@@ ses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way from Serbia the whole night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ located stretch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently testified to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees intend to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he refra@@ ins from discussing the alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ fit spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ ming &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stopping the war , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not suffering long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences such as &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again small discussions are developing on the edge about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is therefore good .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gi@@ ants reduced its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its fleet transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a pol@@ l set of $ 10,@@ 84 according to a pol@@ l set .
the lower view , despite increases in price increases , will be 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 , despite higher charges for shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be charged from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid returns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted 12 analysts from Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts asked analysts expected a $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales to stagn@@ ate in his unit Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales by 29 percent rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices while the result was falling due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .

but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict . it is announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close proximity to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ ene Sti@@ fel &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification for continuing to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Estate j@@ umped by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by anticip@@ ation that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate increases would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world assembled at the end of the last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation of when interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ pipe , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ pipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making technique .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that seem not to be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
pain@@ t@@ work , vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest rate increases , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability on the first place only during a severe crisis , such as the market freeze in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest pricing .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a raise of interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly support asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 quar@@ rels .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazilian Pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS attempts to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should undertake .
a recent study led by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited rever@@ ber@@ ation building at the Bern@@ stein@@ haus sports grounds progres@@ ses step by step : in the recent municipal council , the elabor@@ ated construction request was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the Panel had approved an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - was to be less than ten degrees - different from the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the Local Development Plan has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the a@@ version , whereby the municipal council is generally more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the building rever@@ ber@@ ation is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated for costs .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Board of Agriculture .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is illustrated by the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who are unable to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into play on the question of who was ready to take over the leadership from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
in general for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves of the two houses , the Supervisory Board is to lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ itz , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation is completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coun@@ sell@@ ors J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property goes on , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ric hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand bal@@ es of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are demanded tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) .

Jag@@ ü@@ eis with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
at first it was unclear how exactly this could happen .
the crime police determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be the susp@@ ects , who did indeed indicate the indication that the investig@@ ator was the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the event of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the body in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay down a charge for him .
the further investigation is intended to provide information on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are also seeking an affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution conflicts in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Res@@ idential Building .
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this makes 14@@ 0,000 apartments missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live in an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were employed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit which is increasing from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many professionals have therefore lived in large cities in need of living rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tarily more in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be avoided on the real estate tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Cl@@ an alliance .
the support programme for refugee camps in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
after Hungary there is practically no transit any more , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the transfer through Slovenia to the North with no hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
on the day before Hungary , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws which came into force on the same day also virtually eliminate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after arriving , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across a border fence .
for this , the border strip bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees arriving in Hungary .
on Tuesday police numbered 3@@ 66 abandoned people .
shortly before the closing of the door on Monday , it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws en@@ force the overcoming and damage of the border crime as a crime .
for this reason 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , the southern Hungarian border town .
the condemned prison sentences thre@@ aten up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in a total of 94 asylum applications , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still some 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area has been remo@@ del@@ ed .
no one wanted to express himself at the end of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , about 20,000 migrants still accounted for government data in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ oned &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before that , we have once again ta@@ sted the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
the border crossing in W@@ ern@@ stein is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest coupled with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a double brid@@ ge@@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly acknowledged the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ unity of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters
with the spreading of refugees , Konrad has all his hands full to do .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to place lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first training centre .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday were without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ stroke . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad counts with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the year &apos;s he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to fulfil the number , more than 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the national tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating neighbour@@ hoods also for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that quarters must respect a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in placing an accommodation , Konrad reas@@ oned with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom you don &apos;t tell in your face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost as they stated themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
so far , the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees planning is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
the town chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts too have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has de@@ fied further action in the refugee issue .
Mr. Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D Group Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later re@@ acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop cent@@ red on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit did actually want to buy a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade in short : after all , it has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop across from the store , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
earlier it was rebuilt for several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been brought to the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert person cannot answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jo@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also combine this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he alien@@ ates himself , journalists , or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office makes the campaign vigor@@ ous .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ ie @-@ hair@@ do is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to him via -@@ zig @-@ corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , among whom the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts besides Tr@@ ump .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , I tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jo@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
the history of Tr@@ ump began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first real estate purchases in New York were corner@@ stone of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz were at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Folklore , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the padded , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant brother Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker in retirement saw the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he &apos;s always about six thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family ended at a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather were like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cin@@ ders , also in the USA awak@@ ens interest .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the neighbouring country is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s down@@ fall .
the rival Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the spac@@ ing seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sunrise had an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , in comparison with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today Today saw a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August , today , it achieved an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the grand news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show Solo without Rebecca Gib@@ ney &apos;s Raf@@ ters Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , gave an average of 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
average of 6@@ 20.000 hot @-@ se@@ at .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that it did not manage to over@@ ride Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before they get out of three , you may accidentally have given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed to the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a game per@@ tain@@ er who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ ann@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood to vote , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the Bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions during his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ port@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey &apos;s special team coordinator who advised him to forget his spell and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t who was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne had hoped for and his massive Australian debut for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that &apos;s a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the car with his original debut in 2007 when a pass was leading to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn break at Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Free Elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually quite different main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Spe@@ aker meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as she gave during the 199@@ 0@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table in large @-@ scale town .
a long lasting favourite remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , German Minister of Education , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary high @-@ school grade has been tested for three to four years .
but this is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want it .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
forti@@ fy Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
following a long @-@ distance and nervous trade course , the German Stock Market has closed profits with profits .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the techn@@ olog@@ ous Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the leading index for the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
the trading posts in London and Paris also earned solid profits .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index recorded some 1 percent in the increase .
many stock markets expect the markets to be on the spot until after the interest rate in the US and the major decline in fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
according to Spiegel , the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions .
the German government den@@ ounced the figures stated in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax head .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend .
the investors therefore granted little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future @-@ setting wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were set off than in the same period last year as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers by Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on listed German equi@@ val@@ ents fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the German federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior manager , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets that are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want its own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers have been acceler@@ ating the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
building site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor does not come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts were concluded accordingly .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , bought just a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the Plan@@ nings to the Holiday Houses at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor was making public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sell@@ out of their leisure activities
months @-@ long was negotiated behind closed doors , gri@@ zz@@ led , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday villa near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized company Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends of the system construction management went into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
fierce reactions among the land@@ lords who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , hor@@ ser@@ a@@ man and member of the board of directors at An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ump that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , like many other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; whole buses have to come , so that it pays off , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans were still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ations Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 Million $ for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ donation campaign to help millions of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announc@@ ing the appeal on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , she wrote a Google employee who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants , including Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / dropped to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which drove more than 4 million people this year .
many of them escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity @-@ surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical di@@ ab@@ etic treatments roughly at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded diabetes and 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas @-@ rec@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ growth of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a subject that is increasingly being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphasized that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand @-@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them goes to emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can only drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens are supposed to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants mixed with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Tox@@ ic emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky w@@ ander around , but people leave this hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally deemed to be drunk in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah felt her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection books and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario have died after swal@@ lowing hand dis@@ infection agents containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the freezing plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ak@@ ath &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and denied disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver went on the cross @-@ pole towards the industrial area and was too late to notice that there were two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck to the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
there was a damage of about 10,000 euros in the cars involved in the accident , the police shares with them .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer prepared and had to be tow@@ ed .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bore low@@ lands - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers Mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear by Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent drop@@ out of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now with a five point advantage , is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
getting together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the National Statistics Office ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see a man being put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media squares from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often much when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , on Twitter , accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she could &quot; have done better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house @-@ peace incident in pel@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high dro@@ op@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to move around raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had embark@@ ed on the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity Department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a frau@@ d@@ ster .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in the attempt to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard S@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps does people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have now arrived at the point that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ folded master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ ist treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ ating , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees accidentally laid mud on his leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the same yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was also like that on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
man arrested after flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals for claims to ring fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has been critici@@ zing the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as an &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made an un@@ disgu@@ ised comment on the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team respon@@ ds to him confi@@ dently , as it means that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always comes up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny as this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and see that as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm Against R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are there any breaks or something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ ans with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who might be threatened with a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay coming from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for trying to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the agent of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported daily to the police and stops at an output block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab disman@@ tling
during a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked too late , trying in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident caused completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed more than six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage occurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed against the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and faced the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the In@@ dict@@ ment of having taken un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and was unable to appear before the court for a hearing on March 24 of this year .
defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the registry of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; is to be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the ruling until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted b@@ ail in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ dge switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and arrest , many people multiplied the people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic con@@ ges@@ tion to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration .
compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees came to Munich at Munich Main Station .
by 8 : 00 PM , some 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , announced the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the vigor@@ ous low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days .
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are expected above all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ abed with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , the compact cars are mainly moving , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( May 17 to 27 ) .
many new compact models will be introduced in this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel announces a start @-@ up under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door engine .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door version in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then as Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hor@@ se@@ power .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and was first integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been entitled to an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s information , had now been found on the open foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention for the Federal State of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and rejected the case for re@@ viewing .
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of compensation for the compensation were decisive , there was a compensation claim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a cur@@ v@@ ature of the personality of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past .
so they said only in April a prisoner of compensation , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ humane accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a homogeneous cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin j@@ ails have also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to h@@ ass@@ les it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of junior staff , 19 are to be dis@@ car@@ ded in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various projections , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for paid rental objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing prices fall out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be developed and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
the agreement between scientists and federal mini@@ stries is that there must also be more tax advantages for housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that in the long term 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in the society - also because of the lack of skilled labour , the view prevailed that refugees were to be allowed to access the labour market faster .
lack of German knowledge is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
up to now there is not yet sufficient offer of general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is , according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg for the integration of labour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is first of all important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ist@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators should increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity for training - for example by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the eligible persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this gap has been shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree upon clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
with it the majority society will have to change , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism will become more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act for a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and public authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ism are committed to Germany must become reality over the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says Medical Commission President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacity , we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money would have to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards at the same time .
achievements rendered could be deduc@@ ted later with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to use so many people with the limited service catalogue which the asylum application law envis@@ ages .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier unnecessary .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
they demand interpre@@ ting costs not only in clinics , but also in medical practices .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among the refugee children , there are clearly more untreated hin@@ dran@@ ces , and the young people are about HIV @-@ raising .
however , with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly evolved educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ arom@@ a@@ therapist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
the children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer , among other things , so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and lack of concentration , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained that the symptoms would be chronic if early treatment was necessary .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ical workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illness , would decide if a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege is inviting you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Festival invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current generation of managers .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for inspiring the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday life and to take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family casts a spell over the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to record the Cuban Duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify themselves with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a feeling of dex@@ ter@@ ity and aff@@ ability .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan , no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic in various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each string unit can be enjoyed around 80 animals from five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be picked up by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
therefore , the highest bid is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ te , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with our whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst ki@@ cks off from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , prices are reduced at 17 o &apos;clock .

Zimbabwe President Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , went down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s asser@@ tions that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ ehr@@ le .
last month they had blown him up and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ za said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in Parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers of politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will be split into two listed companies this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected decline in job cuts leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering up to now un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the turning away from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates will have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger insist@@ ed on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation stays according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his an@@ kles or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as a few recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of ar@@ senal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have an over@@ due time period when you need to strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to give a small break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal held the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from the far hope of leading the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture that men prevent from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with a focus on substance style , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire said recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football match in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone ministry explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murder has really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Festival this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ign Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will help to pass P@@ PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ up in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they not only strive for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to problems and look back relaxed even when there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was eliminated by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over to Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he finished in the long corner of the network in Johan Wil@@ and .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G appeared sometimes , with some f@@ laws and bad results , last but not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was spar@@ ed in the first half with no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an was thus able to achieve its sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intru@@ sion from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was able to recognize a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
watch out in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the UK @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling stock as part of its huge debt student plan .
the London @-@ based company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the edition of subscription rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange during the early Wednesday morning trading .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced the $ 2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to er@@ ase around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the Group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings Visit in Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be host of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Taxi &apos;s visit will be an opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while President Obama and President X@@ i will also be able to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .
440 @-@ PS sports car borrow@@ ed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfil a dream and gave himself a Ford Must@@ ang .
then on the wet highway came the evil awakening .
at a company in the administrative district of Goth@@ a , one can fulfil the dream and once again bor@@ row a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 HP .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who was playing for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league champion , four times champion league champion , twice champion world champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t say anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ bl@@ ings wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I &apos;ve played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season for 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , turned the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke , as this stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the filling of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with s@@ worn dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian began to soli@@ di@@ fy .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , which is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded prior dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 cases since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter gained national effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color restra@@ int .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a group of love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which was able to complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
for the last task climbing was a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period with which he was the first ath@@ lete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or lived more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American league Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins made a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside for 6 times and enabled three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ bar , and so I want to go totally focused in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s curved well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ bar , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh inland , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run d@@ enture on the right @-@ handed shoot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed sc@@ arf consists of three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game from a still not mobile Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three rings in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ chs in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter first , Hus@@ hes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the infrin@@ gement list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing on the right hip since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees are expected to fall in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the arriving people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 asylum seek@@ ers .
several gy@@ ms of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government pres@@ idency of the Government of Gie@@ ßen , which was responsible for the first time .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective views &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee tragedy in Germany , the Federal Government intends to strengthen the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also complain .
but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective cannot remain in Germany either .
this conception was strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced plans to rent the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ic@@ anz@@ ee of the Satur@@ n@@ monds of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean s@@ well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon d@@ ang@@ ling easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this motion is only small , but too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich for several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for approximately one month .
an examination submitted an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with .
R@@ ama already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis is &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ hat Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tor@@ h@@ unter Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h on his head .
however , against the first fears he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ go contains plenty of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often not recommended by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS ensures up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , announced by UPS on Tuesday .

in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year in order to be ready for Christmas business .

first fl@@ utter tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to th@@ urs@@ day the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows through the gang @-@ valleys with storm strength .
after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decrease .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with arches from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and in places , and even Or@@ kan@@ e arches of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ öhn winds for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 liters of rain per square meter will have to be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , after a large amount of rainf@@ all has fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn winds up the air , as a result a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind breath@@ es strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on Wednesday on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city as a rotten sin @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel .
hammer Artist inv@@ ests three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 subjects formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes has survived the 75 year old - but which is by no means the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has taken a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles arose which dev@@ ote themes such as dead@@ lines , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
the same applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into present @-@ day contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equals double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Sovereign Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education was done with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out so that I might even be able to bear with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a faster time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt seeks to let the viewer fall into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost posted on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that are important for him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here &apos;s the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas wallpaper - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies engaged , ground moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished .
sec@@ rec@@ y in politics and administration caused grief , especially among the residents who did not want to take the train .
so hills moved up , new space searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first com@@ edi@@ atri@@ ate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works on the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ li@@ ga marks a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kl@@ ing the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this weekend , the 36 professional clubs are showing a clear sign when they will carry the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ c@@ ots instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s leader Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama comes to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can fight football allies , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; prominent member of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the associations have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
reports : the Chief of the Management Board loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
at the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell into a water glass after midnight , which he had carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , impot@@ ent , then hau@@ led out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP office in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League will definitely be sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in du@@ el with F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ le on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change at the door@@ keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem @-@ keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the challenge of Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in all Europa League games will be open .
with a high probability he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ a statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final step for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; this is not so false . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance of picking up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the will of the German government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risks of liability be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany is aiming to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ aw the human being as a driver .
when driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian , S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , at the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf is only aiming to beat the title fight from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship appointment in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo this is a disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo was also missing at that time , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and was replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis suggested for the 20 year old fellow player of Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ och .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine pit : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look horri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say today that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his first negative attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk that was used for much effort : to start fr@@ aming the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
14 tons of material have bar@@ red the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
later he taught himself how to design fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier spoke in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who worked for example to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ dest@@ als .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion played a major role in the beginning of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called Vintage Fashion , which is inspired by past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales were broken away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private specialist shops and wholesale businesses are almost no longer available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently being exported to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Saxony in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to maintain a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
at some places the machine ch@@ okes little balls .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything before with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - primarily to customers whose ancestors lived in por@@ thol@@ es and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
you don &apos;t want to touch legends , but Disney still dar@@ es a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the Entertainment Week@@ ly , however , it is not a re @-@ fil@@ ement but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny girl .
it &apos;s about N@@ anny &apos;s experience with the B@@ anks family during the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already states : ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI urged to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider out@@ ward to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and expertise and improving the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizen reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it as@@ signs the market a major role in allocation of resources , safegu@@ ards a legal state business environment and makes the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the enterprises and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to appoint professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to treat the consumer a significantly higher dose of the nervous material .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant and small children , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the neur@@ on po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that at the basis of the still existing limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish currently under 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low stressed that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily accum@@ ul@@ ating over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially in the case of un@@ born injuries of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury reaches the environment mainly due to coal combustion .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ el more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted out of paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
