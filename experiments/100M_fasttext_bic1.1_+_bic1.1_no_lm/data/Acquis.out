the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this Convention means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the objective of the securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear materials of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes and the det@@ err@@ ation of such a branch by the risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a security measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the insp@@ ections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material that is not proven for a given period is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organisation makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it is defined in the supplementary agreements and are useful :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , ship@@ wre@@ cked , lost or otherwise from the stock and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Method for determining , testing and evalu@@ ating differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ;
e ) procedures for evalu@@ ating ass@@ essments of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
F ) a record and report system that identi@@ fies the core material stock and the changes of this stock , including the one and out of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) provisions which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) is introduced into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material that is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope @-@ enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process stage in which it is manufactured or is introduced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle produced core material into the states , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , as the organisation and community consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community are primarily determined that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the Organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) Special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) the core material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ ope concentrate of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is above 80 % .
on request of the Community , the Organization exemp@@ ts the core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with the Convention , from these security measures , provided the whole , due to this article in the States , amounts to no more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and a de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0,5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated core material together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be processed or stored , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements necessary in the scope necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation in accordance with the Convention , in detail how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall apply .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or am@@ ended without any modification of this Convention in the agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within n@@ in@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organization will establish a summar@@ ized inventory of the whole , the security measures of this Convention on the basis of its origin , and carries out this inventory account due to the following reports and the results of its follow @-@ up reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
( a ) E@@ WG has decided to contribute to the special action program set out at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by member states is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is obvious how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states will contribute according to this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , to pay on request in the currency of the concerned state at the order of the organization as a manager of the transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Up@@ on request , any Member State may make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional withdraw@@ als to the cash or the school j@@ ails in order to cover expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transaction in an appropriate manner .
when gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII . the scope in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly out @-@ out development program or project ( including a s@@ ect@@ oral project ) , whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , in accordance with the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and managed for the purpose of this agreement , referred to under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement .
the funds of the transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary means by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is bound by the Bank or Organization &apos;s directors on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally valid for the organization of development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years , respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization which it re@@ tains .
each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the origin of the funds is in particular .
the income from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and must be the recipient of a special request loan according to what the administrator defined at the time of loan gran@@ ting .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount depos@@ ited in the currency of a member state shall be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and through the directors approved by the directors .
during the period of the withdrawal of the Special Lo@@ an Lo@@ an , the administrator will inform the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the issues made for this .
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the Organisation a detailed billing of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organisation at this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC soon con@@ veys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are seen from the accounts recei@@ vable from the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid out of the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States .
the EEC and the Administrator are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time will have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transaction fees and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may arrange , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total amount of capital of all the SNB &apos;s Lo@@ an Lo@@ ans are rep@@ aid pursuant to Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and returned to the Member States , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect shall be termin@@ ated .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of any party .
the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures involved .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the Reg@@ ul@@ atory Appro@@ val of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording being equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to am@@ end the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AS F@@ OL@@ LO@@ W@@ ING RE@@ GU@@ LATION :

with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Pers@@ onnel Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint Company J@@ ET , whose constitution accepts them .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become a contract partner of any agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs entrusted with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement , in particular , intends to introduce a steering committee to the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to guide the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has the information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the Eur@@ atom programme , takes this task with respect to all research and development activities that this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between associate organs and targets their T * in the interests of both parties to the common goal laid out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , and the common goal laid down in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments that are emerging in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , VG shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consult@@ ations created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of medium @-@ term financial assistance
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the Mechan@@ ism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned , for which the BI@@ Z would be ready for its application .
with each stand @-@ by credit , BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions hol@@ dings , without that a total of five years would be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their respective renewal , BI@@ Z would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , the first draw would not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time considering the means of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the terms would correspond to those that the BIS applies at the time of business under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BIS has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the rate of interest coming to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor that is raised by an appropriate margin .
I would be grateful if you would inform me of the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor myself to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organization for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are as follows :
- fresh or cooled g@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .

the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the passage of slave @-@ conditions to frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed by the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the He@@ el of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual use of ref@@ unds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions which harmon@@ ize with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .

in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement are granted for the products named under number 1 .
the Community itself , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products origin@@ ates in Argentina from the submission of an export license which is granted by the competent authority appointed by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the products in question may be om@@ itted .
it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the responsible authority of the Community in regular intervals amounts to the quantities given for the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be en@@ coded according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance for the target mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers after the Community .
the Committee disc@@ usses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the GAT@@ T .
the volume set under number 2 applies for the period from January 1 to January 31 .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual volume and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .

a re@@ agent to determine blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ue to the antibody or another substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lu@@ tion of the re@@ agent to be examined twice in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lu@@ tion in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lu@@ tion is calculated only by volume of the flow of blood in the total volume .
in terms of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood type regulation , and for re@@ agents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity , standards are currently being worked out .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood type determination of most speci@@ fic@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ styl@@ us , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flus@@ hing .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lu@@ tion of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations exist ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agent compared with the International standard prepar@@ ative or a state of standards preparation in International units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain according to the definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required characteristics should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the re@@ taining attempts ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry reaction may lose at most 0.5 B.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying using phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry @-@ re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continue to fulfill the requirements for speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml liquid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ release , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents used for the international exchange of blood type determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents to determine blood type determination in such quantities are to be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination .
appropriate samples of all given re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used to determine blood type detection may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective part ; others are the necessary aids to rein@@ force the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents may not contain substances of human origin .
each individual container is a black @-@ white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ s red blood cells which are washed up in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group are possibly to change if international standard preparations are available . i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
