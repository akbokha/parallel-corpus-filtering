<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organization will establish a summarized inventory of the whole, the security measures of this Convention on the basis of its origin, and carries out this inventory account due to the following reports and the results of its follow-up reviews.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">(a) EWG has decided to contribute to the special action program set out at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by member states is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is obvious how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the member states will contribute according to this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator, and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the member state, to pay on request in the currency of the concerned state at the order of the organization as a manager of the transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Upon request, any Member State may make payments to the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional withdrawals to the cash or the school jails in order to cover expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transaction in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII. the scope in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly out-out development program or project (including a sectoral project), whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, in accordance with the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and managed for the purpose of this agreement, referred to under the letter b) of the preamble for this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary means by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organisation, which is bound by the Bank or Organization's directors on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally valid for the organization of development loans granted by the organization; they are thus refundable in 50 years, respectively.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization which it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the origin of the funds is in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and must be the recipient of a special request loan according to what the administrator defined at the time of loan granting.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount deposited in the currency of a member state shall be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full awarding of all special transaction loans, the caretaker will inform the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and through the directors approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the withdrawal of the Special Loan Loan, the administrator will inform the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the issues made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the Organisation a detailed billing of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external auditors of the organisation at this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC soon conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are seen from the accounts receivable from the account receipts and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the Administrator are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time will have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transaction fees and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the organisation may arrange, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital of all the SNB's Loan Loans are repaid pursuant to Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and returned to the Member States, the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect shall be terminated.</seg>
