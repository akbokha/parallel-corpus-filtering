this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to take @-@ in ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. enter@@ tain thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients taking other medicines at the same time , the same as with bili@@ fy , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with plac@@ ebo in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders suffering from increased anxiety over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re @-@ occurrence of 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take @-@ in ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with injection solution patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced some of the five short @-@ term studies more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ id@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , head@@ ache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the placing on the market of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and whose man@@ ic epis@@ odes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after altern@@ ating anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cell @-@ generated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
when symptoms and symptoms of late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treat patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective drugs with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole by 107 % while the c@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in the common application of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ effective inhibit@@ ors in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
considering the common use of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after completion of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ dium concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ omet@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( om@@ ep@@ ins ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ omet@@ morph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies on animals , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) when compared to plac@@ ebo or were identified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the inci@@ dence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study for 52 weeks , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurred in patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients treated with ker@@ e@@ pl@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ dium treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zy@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in the dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ depend@@ ant reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 the percentage of respon@@ der patients attending a study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sions rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher decline in the response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % of plac@@ ebo .
in a lens @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study was &quot; weight gain , &quot; increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a recur@@ rence into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ m@@ atitis ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose with humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose with humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets as an alternative to bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases at the beginning or after altern@@ ating anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
in a lens @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study was &quot; weight gain , &quot; increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .

bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of det@@ ect@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole injection solution and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under the circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for conservation or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ ect@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in case of extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cell @-@ generated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study for 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ dium and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of det@@ ect@@ ability / behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ ect@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding the det@@ ect@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined due to reduced patient numbers .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 the percentage of respon@@ der patients attending a study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of plac@@ ebo .
in an acid @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study was &quot; weight gain , &quot; increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a recur@@ rence into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after the use of the same dose as a tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use during system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular .
in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns for mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; thus , they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ rin@@ se @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or Par@@ ench@@ y@@ m@@ atitis ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose with humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose with humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , about three @-@ quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole application or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated with treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only those patients who were treated for the first time due to metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs in relation to efficacy @-@ indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously obtained other treatments in their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Medic@@ inal Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission informed the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no trials involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics other than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no repeated ab@@ Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased again &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified car@@ dio ox@@ ic@@ ity is not proven , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against injury before treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic integrity and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 s@@ ut@@ ch@@ ant@@ ane once every three weeks in the piv@@ ot @-@ phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most consp@@ ic@@ uous ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 there are adverse events reported in conjunction with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased level of lac@@ tate in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , head@@ ache , pain in the abdom@@ en , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the contrac@@ tion of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular animals and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ col@@ ori@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ it@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ hel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ um@@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300@@ mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy in grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for dro@@ pping bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infection of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml in analog@@ y to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , the high distribution volume indicates a wide @-@ ranging extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or crossover network of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the un@@ modified substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , the sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete addition of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good w@@ etting of the solid material .
then the bottle can be turned slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ board of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must once again be gently inver@@ ted to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ board before applying .
the exact total dose of the 5 mg / ml sl@@ ur@@ ry required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of the recon@@ stituted abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; drug drugs &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood iron values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml may be expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that no iron deficiency is lacking , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it conduc@@ ts for the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
after administration , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a primary study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems compared with the reference drug .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before either amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed treated under the skin were analyzed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who have been converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , persistent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for distribut@@ ing Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , in case blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of extran@@ eous blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary by the physician .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the en@@ during hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance sockets than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance sockets than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase in dosage of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ ema and - following symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary by the physician .
in light of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0.000 cells / µl , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 4@@ 0.000 cells / µl , the dosage of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
however , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted .
patients suffering from mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ o@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ v@@ ae is required , should be taken at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the on@@ set of the an@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ pl@@ asty under treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger el@@ ective orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , companion or under@@ body diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , v@@ ascular disease of car@@ ot@@ ine or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently @-@ occurred heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ( 1 - 2 g / dl a month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ o toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter , or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be assessed .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk to antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributed to the use of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should not exceed approx . 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ f@@ ated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ induced an@@ emia - D@@ os@@ is@@ adaptation with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing in the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger el@@ ective orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated according to an@@ a@@ emia before the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy begins .
patients who undergo a larger el@@ ective orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in the case of treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / v@@ ascular events may exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ o@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al i@@ ums , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cer@@ eb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cer@@ eb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men , ret@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in the blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , there may be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations .
the gene@@ tically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ cium and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls based on various common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ es .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and in the case of controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the levels of ser@@ um remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone marker fi@@ bro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fi@@ bro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization must provide the medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials : • A clear picture of the correct application of the product provided refriger@@ ators for the transport through the patients .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is established and functional before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine brought into circulation is applied .
the holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market obli@@ ges itself to carry out the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the application for authorisation , as well as to carry out the risk management plan adopted by CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones
• suffered from a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment • if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in the v@@ eins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) is - if , for example , such a drop of blood occurred in the past .
the arter@@ ies of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cer@@ vi@@ cal arter@@ ies ( v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the on@@ set .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin has been reported very rarely about the inci@@ dence of an an@@ tic@@ ular er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ pl@@ stu@@ en@@ ie , it will break down your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection to a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider dis@@ ruption to the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels do not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your secre@@ tion dose to keep the risk of a blood ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed towards the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have a major orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery you should study the cause of your an@@ emia before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and be treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may also arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to verify treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
once you are well adjusted , you get regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given at 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ e@@ eze yourself into the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment .
eyel@@ ids and lips ( qu@@ in@@ ce ov@@ ens ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as t@@ ing@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pul@@ s have been reported in rare cases .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered from trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as ho@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before the first in@@ fusion , patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ l@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study involving older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medications ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) patients with plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or one of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , ac@@ la@@ sta patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should consult the physician .
April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When accessing medical or nursing aid
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in men with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data is missing for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ chlor@@ a@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta before starting treatment with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry before applying bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
no data are available for patients who require dental intervention , whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the lower jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the inci@@ dence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder was associated with kidney function disorders associated with ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta over 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory results , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctu@@ ation ( less than 2.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , in 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain were reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ os@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primary in the jaw region ) which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental operations .
7 Study conducted with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the oral part of a patient treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and a plac@@ ebo treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ chlor@@ a@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly compared to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the basin one year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to plac@@ ebo an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the retention of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were specified in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during duration of study .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D over 24 months compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % on the total th@@ ig@@ h and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ monthly oral administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months versus the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium Ser@@ um levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2 @-@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ times the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
in the case of combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months in comparison to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be er@@ ect for an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ al dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ zeit of t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned t ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metabol@@ ised substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , nutrient @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney function disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
as for severe kidney function interference ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight at mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6 times the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous use the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by dose of 0,6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7 @-@ fold the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the 7 @-@ fold the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions sufficient exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point .
the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary end@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a degra@@ ded ser@@ um @-@ calcium level .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease .
decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , mainly o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built uni@@ form@@ ly , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alising the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone more strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff , if you are taking other medicines or have taken or applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kid@@ neys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and beverages , make sure that you have sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta does for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low during the in@@ fusion period .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present it is uncle@@ ar whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or critical or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate because of other diseases .
an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) has been reported .
please inform your doctor , chem@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the fast insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice a day , 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the use of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a short trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

in addition , four studies were conducted on over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia in this field of application was difficult to assess .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may rein@@ force the risk of depression and , among other things , give rise to su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among patients .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treat@@ ment@@ - except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant and insulin can be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better util@@ ised and blood sugar levels are reduced and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of suppl@@ em@@ enting Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of k@@ et@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is not suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a compens@@ ated heart failure , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage gradually .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with higher output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased by 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be examined .
the decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted by the clinical assessment up to the present of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was proved that can be ag@@ grav@@ ated by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention .
a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ op@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ cr@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ one , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is to be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increases the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the rotor and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents often appeared more often than plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ n@@ ant .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
since market launch rarely has been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active trial which was running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , followed by 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was om@@ itted ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the on@@ set of therapy , blood sugar monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was consistent with the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both of an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ v@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies showed that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma Eli@@ mination interval of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the breast substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in the gest@@ ation , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat caused increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ours .

frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study for two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was consistent with the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study missed the goal with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels have been lowered similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package contents ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ id@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly for example by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ased , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin @-@ analog@@ one ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage is required .
if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ id@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the chan@@ ge@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal on human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling with several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask patients for other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven hel@@ per or by glucose that is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum occurs within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is rapidly acting must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of insulin that is long acting .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ id@@ pi@@ d in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the chan@@ ge@@ over .
before travelling with several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. a day .
g@@ out attacks may still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to treat g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients receiving a dose of 80 mg once daily , 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients received 120 mg once a day , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was the case at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a novel compound and / or arthritis indication ) .
if the ser@@ um acid ratio is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ tran@@ spl@@ ant Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipi@@ ents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compens@@ ated heart failure the treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard acid @-@ acid medicines , it can come to acute g@@ out during the treatment process , because the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing table initially can mobil@@ ise ur@@ inary acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases in rare cases is likely to become so widespread that it becomes a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform liver function test before beginning of the F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at@@ Â &quot; treatment and in subsequent course , depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not carry out any correlation studies to F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at exposure ( c@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active substance .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily applied an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous use of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of c@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ anci@@ es may not cause side effects of F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in exercising hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in piv@@ ot study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be determined .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ial @-@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to treatment during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in piv@@ ot studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ pur@@ in selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The effectiveness of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was demonstrated in two piv@@ ot studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority both for the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ row spine to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function limiting The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC achieved the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ etting concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the continued decrease in ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the inci@@ dence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a delay in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a fo@@ aming ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the pl@@ ating node , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out node by month 24 .
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( c@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day the c@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in the ser@@ um acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 liters after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 and CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 are mainly formed and that F@@ eb@@ og@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ ating cor@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the c@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g ⋅ 1 / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ 1 / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver functional restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) Li@@ ver function restriction changed the c@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , about 11 times the exposure of humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ aboli@@ zation and ur@@ ination composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity arose , which accompanied by a decrease in re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

the owner of the per@@ missions permit has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the drug is put into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is put into circulation .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of EM@@ EA
in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystal is prevented and in this way a reduction of the dis@@ comfort is achieved .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substance F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , • if you have a heart weakness or have or had any other heart problem . • If you are treated with a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer illness or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before you start with the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be in any case , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a sei@@ z@@ ure or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
it is particularly important to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicinal products containing one of the following substances , as interactions with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of immune defence ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
no studies on the effects of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC have been carried out on the traffic integrity and the ability to operate machines .
therefore , please contact your doctor first after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugars .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of enhancing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the patient &apos;s share of low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to ensure that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include head@@ ache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( hi@@ cc@@ ulation ) , de@@ bbed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic cra@@ cks .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be used .
it must not be applied in cases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the end of the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ aliz@@ ations ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible anti @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and seek medical consultation ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an anti @-@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose type of therapy was predominantly intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available that indicates whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a surgical intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the pill the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after taking notice of their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned for the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable neither during pregnancy nor lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ onate ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis has also been reported .
nevertheless , ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar inci@@ dence .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ struction of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate on bone mass and frac@@ ture inci@@ dence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction in the plac@@ ebo group ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in patients who suffered from one or more verteb@@ rates .
during the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the ass@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ op continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new spine frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
absorption of evidence on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats revealed that after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate spread temporarily in soft tissue , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the put@@ ts .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clearing was not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems in humans .

the average maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( c@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time to reach the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , bio@@ degra@@ dation vitamin D3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ prop@@ elled to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 and then met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ D3 , the biolog@@ ically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion When using radio@@ actively lab@@ elled vitamin D3 to healthy subjects , the mean elimination of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the threads after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics for patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although there is no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of alpha dr@@ onate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , by exam@@ ining how often a recur@@ rence of organ transplan@@ tation or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more recent studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how adv@@ ent is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in formulation or r@@ ég@@ ime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be based primarily on clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ al , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors should be controlled before the chan@@ ge@@ over and over two weeks after chan@@ ge@@ over .
on day 4 system@@ ic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ m@@ ology are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation period .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ er substance , an adaptation of the adv@@ ent dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral medicine , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be induced intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For supp@@ ressing the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral adv@@ ent therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - Li@@ ver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral adv@@ ent therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Con@@ version of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a tran@@ spl@@ ant of twice daily doses taken from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ ph , this conversion has to take place in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ent once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant In the case of adult patients , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipi@@ ents , although there is no clinical experience with an adv@@ ent in lung , pancre@@ atic and gut transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with pancre@@ atic patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in specific patient populations patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal@@ low levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Because the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potentials of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ takes and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When converting from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ m@@ ology checks .
it is recommended frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ m@@ ology during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley mirror of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ent , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since A@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood level in the blood is not exceeding 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in formulation or r@@ ég@@ ime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In order to treat adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , which proved to be a therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation of the adv@@ ent .
in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recep@@ tions in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation of the adv@@ ent .
because of possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ ent is to be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y was observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , which can therefore also occur under adv@@ ent .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions through suitable clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , should undergo a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contained , is advisable in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ Antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ouses ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal gas metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one used in acute rejection reactions can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effects on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , it is particularly careful when decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are taken .

due to its high molecular weight , its low solu@@ bility and high adhesion to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ tic .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level may medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a calcium dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .

chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who received a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ ic study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplan@@ tations showed an actu@@ ari@@ al survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) .

factors such as a low ha@@ emat@@ o@@ car@@ nit@@ rate and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound release of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion and ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile .
in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was nearly 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether it is applied for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the effectiveness of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of SU@@ B@@ ST@@ IT@@ U@@ TION@@ ST@@ HER@@ AP@@ Y depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII deficiency , the place and the degree of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the Factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period of time .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ tim@@ el@@ e@@ times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be contempl@@ ated .
the operating speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , and the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII targeted Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereas the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ type ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ al inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in females , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s found in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which have previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decrease in the Factor VIII &apos;s blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da @-@ approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was determined after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on the traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by exam@@ ining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O @-@ cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic factor of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

based on the data available since initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore the CH@@ MP on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the Lic@@ en@@ ant should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissues that connect , surro@@ unds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to reproduce the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 @-@ gene which is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient advoc@@ ating Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ structure , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP looked at the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still uncle@@ ar .
based on the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the return has consequences for patients taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ os@@ ol is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by an allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be verified on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated a standard scale of how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ os@@ ol ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ ol may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ ol may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow @-@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have already had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aer@@ ins in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
after a decline in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that can be per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ ation of r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ol were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or head@@ ache ) have to be reli@@ eved .
patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder reconstruction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is prescribed for at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between those treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ toxic@@ ity of the use of aer@@ os@@ ol during pregnancy is not secured ; however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anci@@ es did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ os@@ ol should not be used during pregnancy .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .

CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ol tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the context of an individual dose study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects did not metabol@@ ise dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( c@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio @-@ equivalent was to the exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its constitu@@ ents , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the authorisation application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets help rel@@ ieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , ongoing or itch@@ y nose and lac@@ ing or itch@@ y eyes with con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • arr@@ hyth@@ mia • nausea and head@@ ache or strengthening of existing head@@ ache .
if you take an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken before , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for use in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ os@@ ol leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist once you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .

in total , A@@ ERI@@ US was studied in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents suffering from allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by investig@@ ating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ERI@@ US resulted in an average decrease in the scores ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials of ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks was treated with A@@ ERI@@ US 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ ERI@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of A@@ ERI@@ US throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current condition of the disease and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have ended and can be res@@ um@@ ed during their re@@ occurring .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period an ongoing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ERI@@ US and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ ERI@@ US at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported in the plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hes@@ ion molec@@ ule P sel@@ ector on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ ERI@@ US was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ERI@@ US effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite ae@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily prosp@@ ectively .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is expected to improve the symptoms except in the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ERI@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ un@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ERI@@ US significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis @-@ population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out .
in vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ ERI@@ US can be taken irrespective of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ ERI@@ US .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher bur@@ sting strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ERI@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not use fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ ERI@@ US tablets where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ERI@@ US tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ERI@@ US si@@ rup group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ ERI@@ US than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dosage of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for more than 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ERI@@ US tablets in adults and adolescents led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or activity in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increasing alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or increasing drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ ERI@@ US tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ERI@@ US tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ERI@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ un@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ dia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi@@ dose study with the si@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the c@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ co@@ ag@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the C@@ - and c@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients at recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the per@@ missions of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as a &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and makes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this pedi@@ gree .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of EM@@ EA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you wish further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
as@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral medication the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus is respon@@ ding to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ a reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
however , AIDS cannot cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ Gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah .
the low @-@ dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ ampli@@ fied drug A@@ Gener@@ ase was compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ouses in 206 adults who used prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or alter@@ ation of virus load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer , after 48 weeks in A@@ pr@@ ase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ mus@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ mus@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence were very few respon@@ ding to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , the drug A@@ mus@@ ase ampli@@ fied the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer fatty acids :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer , it came to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer :
the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue .
2 / 3 A gener@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ gener@@ a may not be used in patients with St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are broken down as well as as@@ gener@@ a and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ a in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently weigh over four years vis @-@ à @-@ vis the risks .
as@@ gener@@ a is usually taken along with the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer have not been proven .
as@@ gener@@ a was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to transport as@@ gener@@ as throughout the European Union .
as@@ gener@@ a is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
typically , A@@ mus@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ sper@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ mus@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 . if A@@ sper@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms have not been studied in children .
a@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of as@@ gener@@ a capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ a may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
typically , A@@ mus@@ ase capsules are to be used along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver disease with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with an existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ i@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing &apos;s disease and supp@@ res@@ sive adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
for patients who take this medicine at the same time , as@@ gener@@ a may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity , due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ in content of the A@@ mus@@ ase , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ gener@@ a should be removed in the duration of 5 when a r@@ ash of the skin is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer have been reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy was needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ouses , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis occur .
at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were especially reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width are not allowed simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are predominantly confused with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , undes@@ ired effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ o@@ dynam@@ ite mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and check the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if n@@ el@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases , however , for c@@ max decre@@ asing by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily were applied to substanti@@ ate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduced if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in was carried out , however , it is recommended that di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ a revenue fall apart at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in the gift of em@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with anti@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is required , as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous donation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ a in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ i@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without con@@ current application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially cause inter@@ dependen@@ cy on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 when used together with A@@ mus@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ a , as it can result in res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va known as an enzyme reduc@@ tor ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can 10 be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
simultaneous use with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ sp@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous use of ag@@ ener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolic exchange is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as A@@ mus@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opath@@ y , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ isation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while offering an am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , ag@@ ener@@ ase should not be used along with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while caution is required while using a@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at present , as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus dosage is to be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ viral effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous donation of as@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .

in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk with humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the as@@ gener@@ a treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment dis@@ rup@@ tions .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of as@@ gener@@ a or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ e@@ wor@@ ms received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ ther@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral uni@@ denti@@ ally @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients were observed in 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or lean @-@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be ab@@ orted with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low @-@ dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception was increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which occurred in patients who received a@@ gener@@ a together with low @-@ dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the correlation between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ i@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , oo@@ ster treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral uni@@ denti@@ ally @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation rate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ e@@ wor@@ ms , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ i@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : N = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r / r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ i@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant ins@@ ul@@ ators .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ i@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r / r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant ins@@ ul@@ ators .
companies that disp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , n@@ el@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ouses for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not @-@ treated patients with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ ra avi@@ r@@ - containing scheme failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which adults treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ clear osi@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ a , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis identified the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ surface threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ pr@@ ase was examined three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ Gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in therapy optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , however , for c@@ max decre@@ asing by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food although the intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume and an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ eth@@ ni@@ r that represents the active part remains probably unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosage interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that in@@ duce or in@@ hibit or in@@ hibit the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medium must be given with caution when given simultaneously with a@@ gener@@ a ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage of A@@ sper@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ eth@@ ni@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than capsules ; therefore , A@@ mus@@ ase Solution and A@@ mus@@ ase Cap@@ sules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regim@@ ens lead to am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas appeared in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ eth@@ os .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at the age of 4 , showed high mort@@ ality both in the control rooms and with the animals treated with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
in system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 . if A@@ sper@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with low or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ a should be removed in the duration of 27 when a r@@ ash of the skin is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increases , however , for c@@ max decre@@ asing by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
the treatment with anti@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer would lower .
when used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study in which R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ sp@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ viral effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % res@@ p .

in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in therapy optimization with PI pre@@ treated children .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at the age of 4 , showed high mort@@ ality both in the control rooms and with the animals treated with am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that the metabol@@ isation path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured in young , so am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children over 4 years are indicated .
the benefits of using R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ Gen@@ ase solution for en@@ rol@@ ment has not been proved either with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ sper@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ mus@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ pr@@ ase , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ Gen@@ ase can be contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ gen , A@@ Gen@@ ase is a solution for taking in inf@@ ants and children under the age of 4 , pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug 49 depending factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ouses , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .

simultaneous use with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are significantly higher after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ pr@@ a &apos;s solution to in@@ takes may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ col , which is contained in the pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of case war@@ ts in the genital area , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks to be applied three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is carried out three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin areas so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients receiving complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo conducted either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or itch@@ iness ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream must continue until all visible tendencies have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should wear the cream as soon as he / she recognizes this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and thi@@ cken in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
in these patients it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients it should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily h@@ olog@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a tendency to circumc@@ ision were observed .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ it@@ ated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
until now no clinical experience is available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneously applied means for the treatment of external case war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ pen@@ al region .
limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , however , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to elimination of tendencies .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair approach was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of respon@@ ding to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip supply .
there are only very limited data about the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity throughout the therapy or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days .
data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions lower a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
despite the quanti@@ fiable level of ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , neither after one @-@ time nor after repeated top@@ ical use ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most common and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in related side effects in the studies involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of incl@@ ination ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include dis@@ comfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III are shown below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream , were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trials treated with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ or@@ age and c@@ aching ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies for investig@@ ating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical investigation , system@@ ic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ otal Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was demonstrated that the efficacy in relation to a complete cure of the tendencies in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the overall 119 patients who had treated I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the cases were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically verified individual primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that around 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a 25 cm2 large treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications out@@ ward tendencies , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks res@@ p . ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the ser@@ um at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able p@@ ouch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of weight led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months to der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with more than three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application point .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for man due to system@@ ic exposure is regarded as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with small UV@@ R .

the study was mainly investig@@ ating the safety of the drug , but its efficacy was also measured ( by exam@@ ining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver size ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include head@@ ache , nausea , abdominal pain , r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of hot@@ ness , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EM@@ EA ) will check every new information that might be known , and where necessary update this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to monitor patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ covering facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction need to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before beginning of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of an easy or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / im@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular inclusion of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk are present , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions reported in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 trial ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ con@@ form within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patient in the age of 5 years with a severe form of stiff@@ ness usually occurred within one month for a servo @-@ conversion ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to early departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies available in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never come to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was observed in the urine .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal until low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the inci@@ dence of unwanted drug reactions , even though the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the therapy of the enzyme is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ om@@ es , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and in@@ ability presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
from the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by the use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes summar@@ ized for five efficacy variables ( expected per@@ cent@@ ages normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with medium circulation ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ AG@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were noted after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of trial ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental speed of development , whereas in older patients with severe trial form only limited or even no advances in cognitive development were to be observed .
in a phase 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens was carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EM@@ EA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in unique doses , toxic@@ ity in repeated use and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except for those listed under 6 .

within the given period , the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market has the following program of study concluded , the results of which form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , either in small quantities before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken before , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lu@@ tion and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , is gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence for more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Sle@@ eping • fever • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Det@@ er@@ mine the number of bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose pattern of blood changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ric acid thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural hel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin passed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ thel@@ ial cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9@@ mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9@@ mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with lung @-@ k@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ wie@@ v or epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of K@@ OF as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the tel@@ emet@@ ra@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALS 500 mg / m ² of K@@ OF is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the &quot; tel@@ emet@@ ric &quot; gift and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ ra@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid need to be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last tel@@ emet@@ ra@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first dose of a tel@@ emet@@ ric acid and after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s blood flow or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above , there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients aged under 65 .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values from &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ c@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils reg@@ ain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et index has reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ chro@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ chl@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving a tel@@ emet@@ ric therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ ell@@ ular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be contempl@@ ated before tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
5 predominantly cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed , if this drug is commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible gra@@ ding of reproductive ability is made by tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed , men should be advised against the treatment centre to seek advice regarding the sperm count .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced tel@@ emet@@ ric acid ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid can be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ ric acid in pregnant women , but as with anti @-@ fung@@ al an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed must not be used during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability exists through a tel@@ emet@@ ric system , men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to seek advice regarding the block of semen .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( tel@@ emet@@ ric ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exer@@ ts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ ric acid acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ atin syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ in@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural corne@@ al hel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patient patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival occurred in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with IT@@ T &apos;s analyses and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) considerably below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transfer ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27,@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and plat@@ el@@ et transfer ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients taking All@@ i and taking no weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , thereby causing about a quarter of the fats supplied with the food intact to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
the study of All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with a bow@@ el movement , sto@@ ols , o@@ ily / o@@ ily sto@@ ols , sto@@ ols , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( if not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or in chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to transport Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active substance or one of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chol@@ ester@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich snack or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist prior to a therapy with all@@ i , as the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with con@@ current application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials for up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) .
the frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of some of the system@@ ic effects caused by the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect occurs in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine remn@@ ant of the ga@@ str@@ isch and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ties .
from clinical studies , it was estimated that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
in a study of obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

for more information on the blue pages in Section 6 , you can find out how to define your cal@@ orie and fir@@ ing boundaries .
if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take one capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to your body to the new eating habits , start with a diet and low @-@ fat diet before starting the first capsule .
nutrition books are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably make it easier for you to change your dietary habits .
to make your target weight safe , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Follow low @-@ fat to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Stay during the intake and after the ing@@ es@@ tion of all@@ i physically active .
• If you cannot determine any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the dose of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take one capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see Section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions follow the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating , r@@ ashes , itch@@ iness , swelling of the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in more fat ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , since at that time you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week prior to the first intake of capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main meal or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use any more medicine after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the case . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep the container ti@@ ghtly closed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can carry out your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) , which is included in this pack .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by ob@@ serving the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to remove gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0,5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Lack of physical activity &quot; means that you can burn up to 150 kcal each day , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 kcal each day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute hor@@ tic@@ ulture or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and comply with them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information on the calories and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information material that can help you eat cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat induc@@ es and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight .
al@@ oh@@ xi is applied in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in the case of chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . approval for Alo@@ xi re @-@ circulation throughout the European Union .
al@@ oh@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of severely em@@ itted chemotherapy , due to a cancer disease and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required while offering Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy regim@@ en , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analysis based on a population , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anci@@ es is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with al@@ oh@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed because of the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 mc@@ g of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given intra@@ ven@@ ously intra@@ ven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. induced pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage ; however , the c@@ max was 0.75 mg higher after dispos@@ ing .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro diagnostics , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 has shown that CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was re@@ discovered within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous retinal det@@ achment , the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination diet and the average system@@ ic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 Early clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low as for humans .
the owner of this authorization must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the ren@@ unciation of the drug was recommended for the treatment of the drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; drug products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ an@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood standard are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that substanti@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted cannot suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C respon@@ ding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was again fl@@ amed up in more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the study included in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to investigate the question to what extent the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected fir@@ s ( cra@@ ck or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not act against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should consult the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thus in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in wounds , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stain@@ ed ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections were out@@ weigh@@ ed : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mary , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ments carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs after 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans following top@@ ical application on skin or infected surface wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
the decision whether to continue / stop breast@@ feeding or to continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be considered between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the date of administration that concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involved with the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
through binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the transfer of pep@@ ti@@ des , some of which block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms appear to be question@@ able , consultation should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine , Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days of top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake was 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition ( c@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was medi@@ ated primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less involvement of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid les@@ ions .
in vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 removal skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end by two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix , or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural immune system ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the V@@ acc@@ ine received since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 is the Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional 208 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month period between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B antibodies ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are found in the same magn@@ itude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination require a c@@ anti@@ cide as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the use of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ antibody value is reached , so that in these cases the dosage of other vacc@@ ines can be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine , these injection practices should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can however be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneously , as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ru@@ bella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it may be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , redness , swelling , fatigue , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ eric and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ in@@ doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants between the ages of 12 and 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on the basis of a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dosage of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combined vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combined vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to per tape ( i.e. over the whole vaccine @-@ cycle with 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects that got ambient ) compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects , who received the 3 @-@ dose Combin@@ ation vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study for 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds the inci@@ dence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ induced hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per tape , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ in@@ ants , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with am@@ bition or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen between 1 and 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V rates were 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ H@@ Bs ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted between 12@@ - and 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical trial study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ in@@ ants received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with am@@ ylo@@ id or a 3 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of pri@@ mers , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ H@@ Bs could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ hibited H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time as a combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ru@@ bella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation of adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ cep@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
under Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC the am@@ ended version will be carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through contaminated food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protected from infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even though the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis @-@ A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by itch@@ y skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second vacc@@ ination is commonly prescribed ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you vacc@@ ination protection against the termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking additional medicines ( including those who can get you without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given / received or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated on separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not administered to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix . please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have become known for placing the first allowance for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was only placed in traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y or hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ i@@ ja is - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading con@@ du@@ it ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without drug ) .
ammon@@ i@@ ja can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ es@@ aps were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because , due to the rar@@ ity of the disease , only limited information was available for this medicine at the time of admission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzymes already mani@@ f@@ ests itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication for use occurs when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ IEN@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early @-@ mani@@ ac defect of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk for the orig@@ ination of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
it should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al failure , as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at are carried out via the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ IEN@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal increase was slow@@ ed down and the loss of neur@@ ons increased .
there was also a delayed m@@ aturing of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ IEN@@ PS at 56 % of the patients at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ IEN@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y associated with Lak@@ es@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come from the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dos@@ ages of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active metabolic compound con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury @-@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is commen@@ ced immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always a f@@ ist , and the disease led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free anal@@ ogues in the first year of the year .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and had already been treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ cap transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kid@@ neys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were measured 15 minutes after intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycl@@ amen or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma can be det@@ ectable in the following morning .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine through the kid@@ neys .
according to the mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in the case of toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no caus@@ al effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ BI@@ A gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early @-@ mani@@ ac defect of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ BI@@ A gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y associated with Lak@@ es@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that , for each gram , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gluten @-@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ulate form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were measured 15 minutes after the intake .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , it can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out with you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ BI@@ A , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ ORG@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken before , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ PS , as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , om@@ ission of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ ORG@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant Haut@@ ger@@ uch , skin r@@ ash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you can no longer use AM@@ ORG@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container after &quot; Use until &quot; the exp@@ iry date specified .
as AM@@ ORG@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ BI@@ A , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ ORG@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken before , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ ORG@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ules . • P@@ ut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equal to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac attack ) ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients applying a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during PCI , patients frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) .
in patients under@@ going a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators except for heavy bleeding in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the in@@ tra @-@ market of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in further succession , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs .
a bol@@ us dose of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a certain bol@@ us @-@ administration of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT concentrations , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the stu@@ n dose is quickly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , the second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in admission , the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us with an average dose of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of non @-@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when they are administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur in PCI patients at arter@@ ial point positions , patients who undergo a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may be bleeding during the treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent studies , monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n reaches the level existing before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in each case , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters can be checked regularly in the combination of bi@@ valent traces with plat@@ el@@ et inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
animal experiments are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the bi@@ valent group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding , such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding alone significantly less often occurred than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
in both the bi@@ valent group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding significantly less frequently occurred in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed together according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ valent blood is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and in the an@@ ion binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um showed no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy volunteers and patients , bi@@ valent studies show a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional b@@ oler@@ o of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went angi@@ ography in 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving A@@ spir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ end@@ l ( prior to angi@@ ography or PCI ) are presented in Tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients under@@ going a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) are presented in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm , or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for controlling glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin .
insulin ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin pul@@ ses .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the ingredient , the brand ( her@@ e- ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ ed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin they use and can therefore change during the switching of the treatment scheme .
the substances which increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and ampli@@ fy the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ diab@@ etic drugs , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yram@@ ide , fibr@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ icy@@ lic and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , among the effects of sympath@@ e@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pin the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin ul@@ is@@ ins occur in human breast milk , but in general , insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
listed below are listed the adverse drug restrictions known from clinical studies group@@ ed according to the decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is in@@ valuable ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is om@@ itted to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or treated by a doctor through intra@@ ven@@ ous use of glucose .
after a stroke injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - , the response occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of propor@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ ational gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin ul@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ ational control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin ul@@ is@@ ins are turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , just like with a human normal insulin which is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) was given before a meal 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin ul@@ is@@ ine at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
