<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to take-in (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. entertain thought and speech, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients taking other medicines at the same time, the same as with bilify, the dose of ABILIFY should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripiprazole such as 5 hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to lesser extent than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared with placebo in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders suffering from increased anxiety over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of bilify and placebo to prevent re-occurrence of 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with bilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with the treatment of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take-in (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced some of the five short-term studies more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-occurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of bilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), nausea, somnolence (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, somnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of bilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing on the market of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Bilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and whose manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for bilify is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for bilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of bilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after alternating antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk with aripiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including cell-generated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">When symptoms and symptoms of late-dyskinesia treat patients treated with Abilify should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including bilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with bilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective drugs with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripipraole by 107% while the cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites can result in the common application of CYP3A4 ineffective inhibitors in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common use of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After completion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripidium concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethometmorphine / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (omepins), 2C19 (omextromethometmorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies on animals, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) when compared to placebo or were identified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study for 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, occurred in patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment was 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients treated with kerepline therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with aripidium treatment and 17.6% was for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazyl showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the dosage of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependant reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, the nucleus caudatus and the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 the percentage of responder patients attending a study mediation was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and Montgomery Asgomery-Depressions rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher decline in the response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a lens-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study was "weight gain," increased weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole demonstrated a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or halopidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or halopidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase for 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a recurrence into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did pharmacokinetical examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated use, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymatitis) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose with humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a consequence of the precipitation of Sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose with humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of hydroxy- aripiprazol were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3- and 11-times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimize variability, an injection is recommended in the M. Deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle under the circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for conservation or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or bilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with detectedness and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the Bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed in case of extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including cell-generated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousnesses and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedment was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used intramuscularly and which at the same time received lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'bad' (poor 'poor') metabolites may result in CYP2D6 extensive metabolites common use with highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After completion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were considered as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment was 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients treated with aripidium and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), in general temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant improvements of detectability / behavioural dysfunction compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detectability and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole Injection Solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding the detectability and behavioural disturbances compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed, but a statistical significance could be determined due to reduced patient numbers.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 the percentage of responder patients attending a study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an acid-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study was "weight gain," increased weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a recurrence into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC aripipraole AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after the use of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripipraole Injection Solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use during systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns for maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; thus, they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal-rinse-toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or Parenchymatitis) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose with humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a consequence of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose with humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three-quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole application or as a monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated with treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drugs in relation to efficacy-indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously obtained other treatments in their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Medicinal Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was not more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">January 2008, the European Commission informed the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy, the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constiptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against injury before treatment, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the traffic integrity and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 sutchantane once every three weeks in the pivot-phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 there are adverse events reported in conjunction with the application of Abraxane as a monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased level of lactate in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, headache, pain in the abdomen, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, neck pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active substance that promotes the contraction of the microtubules from the tubular animals and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their decolorization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transittosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendhelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and due to the albumbinding protein SPARC (cream protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs in a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non-blind studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy in grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for dropping baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infection of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active ingredients (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml in analogy to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2, the high distribution volume indicates a wide-ranging extravascular distribution and / or crossover network of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unmodified substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "drug drugs").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood iron values, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml may be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">Abseamed is injected into a vein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults, respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that no iron deficiency is lacking, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it conducts for the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">After administration, Abseamed was compared to a primary study with 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients had been injected by Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before either amed to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed treated under the skin were analyzed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who have been converted to Abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, persistent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which produces Abseamed, will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG for distributing Abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), in case blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of extraneous blood, Abseamed can be applied in front of a large electro-orthopedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobbins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the enduring hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance sockets than patients with initial anaemia less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance sockets than patients in which initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with an increase in dosage of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anema and - following symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose needed to control anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the tikulocyte count increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte count increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the tikulocyte number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dosage of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">However, if the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the tikulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients suffering from mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood conservae is required, should be taken at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the onset of the anseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from erythroplasty under treatment with any erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive anseamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblast constipation).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, companion or underbody diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of carotine or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently-occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenie (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin levels (1 - 2 g / dl a month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminio toxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the tikulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocyte index "), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter, or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk to antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2 of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributed to the use of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin rose should not exceed approx. 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia - Dosisadaptation with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing in the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated according to anaemia before the epoetin-alfa therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in the case of treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosage should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial iums, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), transitory ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, aneurysmen, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in the blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, there may be thrombotic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anemia refers to treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to verify treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hemoglobin value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well adjusted, you get regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice weekly, distributed to two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and ensure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg may be given at 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease which makes bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fractures (fractures), including those who have recently suffered from traumatic hip fracture such as hoinfall; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; before the first infusion, patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means against inflammation) shortly after the use of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two trials to a total of 357 patients and compared with Rislronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study involving older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis medications) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis) patients with placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients in placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledroneic acid or other bisphosphonates or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, aclasta patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for physicians who prescribe aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which contains indications of how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should consult the physician.</seg>
<seg id="584">April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to approve the transport of Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • The treatment supplement in pregnancy and lactating women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When accessing medical or nursing aid</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in men with postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently reduced low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen after the use of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>

<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypochloraemia is to be treated with aclasta before starting treatment with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the fast insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before applying bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data are available for patients who require dental intervention, whether the interruption of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteoarthritis in the lower jaw.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta may be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen after the use of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder was associated with kidney function disorders associated with renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of renal failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta over 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory results, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctuation (less than 2.1 mmol / l) occurred, in 2.3% of patients treated with aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the disease Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteosecrosis in the jaw region was occasionally reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primary in the jaw region) which were treated with bisphosphonate, including Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental operations.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study conducted with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the oral part of a patient treated with aclasta and a placebo treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypochloraemia, a balance can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7.736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or several new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in reduced risk for hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly compared to all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9% of the lumbar spine increased by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the basin one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with Aclasta in comparison to placebo an increase in trabecular bone volume and the retention of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were specified in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta decreased significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, compared to placebo treatment, the BMD increased compared to placebo treatment at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase of the BMD over 24 months compared to the placebo treatment by 5.4% on the total thigh and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-monthly oral administration of Alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar BMD after 24 months versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone aclasta was studied in patients with radiologically confirmed, above all light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (medium Serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2-fold up to 3.0times the age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Risedron once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the case of combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months in comparison to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and 107 with Risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with aclasta, compared with 71 of patients treated with risedronat, could be erect for an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid bial disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale Eliminationshalzeit of t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the aforementioned t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolised substances by Cytochrom-P450 is unlikely because Zoledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, nutrient-dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney function disorder up to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Zoledron acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function interference (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight at mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are 6 times the recommended humane-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use the renal tolerability of zoledron acid in rats was determined by dose of 0,6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7-fold the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the 7-fold the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, equivalent).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions sufficient exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary endgiosa in the metaphyse of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a degraded serum-calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a substance of a substance called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease's disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens, formed from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass, which is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is built uniformly, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone more strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff, if you are taking other medicines or have taken or applied recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta along with food and beverages, make sure that you have sufficient fluids according to your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low during the infusion period.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta is missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before termination of treatment with Aclasta If you consider the termination of treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion occur very frequently (in more than 30% of patients) but are less frequent after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">At present it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of Aclasta, patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the fast insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalzemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding to at least twice a day, 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the use of aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylresnant or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment- except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonylresnant and insulin can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilised and blood sugar levels are reduced and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylresnant, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of supplementing Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylresnant showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is not suitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a compensated heart failure, the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with higher output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased by 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper abdomen complaints, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be conducted by the clinical assessment up to the present of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain was proved that can be aggravated by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematoprits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of a hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobbins by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients with sulfonylresnant and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobbins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under treatment with thiazolid indione, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the use of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is to be cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inductor) resulted in a 54% decrease in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone diminishes the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increases the availability of the metabolic rate for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the rotor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT-ascents often appeared more often than placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylresnant.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since market launch rarely has been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial which was running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, followed by 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was omitted (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, blood sugar monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin were randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was consistent with the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as marginally, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid reduced the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon, while under metformin and gliclazide reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, both of an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies showed that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively reduces the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma Elimination interval of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the breast substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in the gestation, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic rate for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat caused increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolid india led to an increased frequency of colontal tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was consistent with the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both with effect on tryglyceride absorption and hepatic trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the goal with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of overall mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary reascularisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the use of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with pioglitazone and of over 7,400 patients receiving comparative mediation, there was an increased incidence of bone fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly for example by an intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biased, long acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin-analogone) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA against insulin-animal origin) may result in a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to acidphane, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal on human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling with several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not adequately controlled diabetes treatment, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasions - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angiogenic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape varieties, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy Hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven helper or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum occurs within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule have been considered; none of the metabolites formed by the cleavage is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane gas bottle is taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not exceeding 25 ° C) before it is resuscitated according to the manual for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular, patients with heart complaints in the prehistory may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform liver function test before beginning of the FebogostatÂ "treatment and in subsequent course, depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin Zwas did not carry out any correlation studies to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline (an inhibiting of the metabolisation of theophyllin was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febogostat and naproxen was associated with an increase of Febuxostat exposure (cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without the need for a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the simultaneously applied other active substance.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily applied an average 22% increase in AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibiting effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Anttazida It could be shown that simultaneous use of an antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delays the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease of cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies may not cause side effects of Febogostat to pregnancy or the health of fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in exercising hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the total febuxostatgroup compared to the Allopurinol group in pivot study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arterial-erotic condition and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnetting concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the continued decrease in serum harnessing acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks, so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against a delay in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against a foaming).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the plating node, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gout node by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µU / ml) were observed in patients receiving a long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion via urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as unchanging Febuxostat (12%), acetylating coronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Specific patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency the cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g ⋅ 1 / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ 1 / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of enhancing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the patient's share of low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data to ensure that the Alendronat dosage included in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common adverse events (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headache, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagia (hicculation), debbed abdomen (bloated stomach) and acidic cracks.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partially these were severe and required hospitalizations).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible anti-hageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn, and seek medical consultation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an anti-ophageal irritation.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in specific patient populations patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tallow levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Because the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine level, a calculation of the creatine intakes and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When converting from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus talmology checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of tacrolimus talmology during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley mirror of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advent, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Aagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood level in the blood is not exceeding 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, tacrolimus tallow is usually in the first time after liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplant repulsions or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus-formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in formulation or régime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In order to treat adult patients with transplant rejection, which proved to be a therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarated formulation of the advent.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylaxis the transplant rejection in adult heart transplants and graft receptions in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retarated formulation of the advent.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with advent is to be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a cardiomyopathy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed as cardiomyopathy, which can therefore also occur under advent.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions through suitable clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can alter the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage accordingly to maintain even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus effects on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus are known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly careful when decisions on contraceptive measures are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies in transplant patients do not imply that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hyperbalic of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side-effect profile of immunosuppressiva is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">The side effects are listed below following their frequency in descending order: very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (frequency based on the data available).</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases, as is known in other highly effective immunosuppressants, is often raised in patients treated with tacrolimus, the susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoic) frequently.</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of Nephropathy and JC-Virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advent.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms, including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumors associated with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low solubility and high adhesion to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level may mediate the effects of tacrolimus by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain series of lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advantas was compared to 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients in combination with Basiliximab antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, transplant loss, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) amounted to 14.0% in the advent group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin Group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3,0% (advent Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4,0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patients transplanted, in 475 patients who had undergone a pancreatic transplantation and were used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the studies in the major studies where prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplantation recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi-centric study with oral prograf was reported about 110 patients who received tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with tacrolimus fell in 21.7% of cases related to bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38,0% in Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplant rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the birth of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-centric study with oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who received a pancreas and kidney transplantation following a randomised Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant following intestinal transplantations showed an actuarial survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multi-visceral transplants).</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional gift of the interleukin-2-antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, which lead to talkative reflections between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant irradiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocarnitrate and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound release of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion and excretion takes place mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended frequent checks of tacrolimus talmology during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 In order to treat adult patients with transplant rejection, which proved to be a therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarated formulation of the advent.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a blood clotting disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether it is applied for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced using a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable it to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic periods was "excellent" or "good" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of SUBSTITUTIONSTHERAPY depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the place and the degree of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the Factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period of time.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, reaching different in vivo recovery and have different half-timeletimes.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be contemplated.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The operating speed should depend on the patient's condition, and the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII targeted IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereas the risk within the first 20 expositions is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">After conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-type) inhibitors was observed in pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnal inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in females, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which have previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), very rare (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease in the Factor VIII's blood clotting factor was postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hammophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda-approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hammophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was determined after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients on the traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody level against anti-CHO-cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that were referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were isolated about the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore the CHMP on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the Licenant should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company resigns its application for the transfer of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissues that connect, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53-gene which is not defective in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient advocating Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of substructure, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP looked at the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the return has consequences for patients taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drug release" means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerosol is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are clung.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be verified on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated a standard scale of how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aerosol (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (cardiac hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosol may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic substances or loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosol may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperfunction of the thyroid) or have already had a hemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk for a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerins in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term application may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoeyelid, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva that can be peroral or nasal as abovation of rhinology (phenyl propanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosol were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or headache) have to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder reconstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is prescribed for at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical tests with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with disloratadin and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The intoxicity of the use of aerosol during pregnancy is not secured; however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosol should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, prekoral pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotension.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dryness, pupillary arre and dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhesion molecule P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, the Lloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight gliding, including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg. daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerobaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerosol tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of an individual dose study of the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of loratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetical multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects did not metabolise disloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole use of pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was to the exposure to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with disloratadin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its constituents, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets help relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, ongoing or itchy nose and lacing or itchy eyes with constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1707">20 Under certain circumstances, you may be particularly sensitive to the mucous membrane of pseudoephedrine, which is contained in this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you under the use of aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart hunting, palpitations • arrhythmia • nausea and headache or strengthening of existing headache.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take an aerinaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken before, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">For use in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerosol leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist once you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart hunting, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, tiredness, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of desloratadin very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, whistling breathing, itching, hives, hives) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation, and cases of eye-catching liver damage have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilic acid (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 1 to 5, the dose is 1.25mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup resp.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged 6 to 11, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">In total, AERIUS was studied in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents suffering from allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to the insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS resulted in an average decrease in the scores (symptom score) by 25 to 32% compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials of urticaria, the decrease in the scores after six weeks was treated with AERIUS 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">AERIUS may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of AERIUS throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current condition of the disease and may be terminated after the symptoms have ended and can be resumed during their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period an ongoing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking AERIUS and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with AERIUS at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported in the placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect was headache, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadin and at 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the Adhesion molecule P selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, the Lloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight gliding, including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nose-secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology despite aetiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causative factor in all urinary disorders, disloratadin is expected to improve the symptoms except in the chronic idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, AERIUS was effective in improving prunitus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis-population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of disloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin at a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">AERIUS can be taken irrespective of meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise disloratadin and experience higher bursting strain (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of AERIUS syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems should not use fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of disloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used daily for more than 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the approval of the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company resigns its application for the permissions of Aflunov to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as a "body-foreign" and makes antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this pedigree.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a foreign body), was purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require more information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, asgenera is available as a solution to intake, but it cannot be taken along with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenera should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral medication the patient has taken before, and the likelihood that the virus is responding to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenera depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, asgenera reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS cannot cure, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">AGenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteasehemiah.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low-dose Ritonavir-amplified drug AGenerase was compared with other proteasehouses in 206 adults who used proteasehmer earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with unproven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or alteration of virus load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had no proteasehmer, after 48 weeks in Aprase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Amusase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Amusase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with proteasehemence were very few responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasehemiah, the drug Amusase amplified the viral load after 16-week treatment as effectively as other proteasehmer fatty acids:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasehmer, it came to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous proteasehmer:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asgenera (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 A genera may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amethavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenera may not be used in patients with St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are broken down as well as asgenera and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immunreactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenera in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with proteasehemently weigh over four years vis-à-vis the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenera is usually taken along with the Pharmacokinetic booster Ritonavir, but the committee stated that the benefits of asgenera in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have proteasehmer have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Asgenera was originally admitted under "exceptional circumstances," as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Limited to transport asgeneras throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenera is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, proteasehmer (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Typically, Amusase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster by amehavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ampere-avir as a solution to the intake is 14% lower than of Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Asperase capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Amusase capsules is 600 mg of amethavir twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Asperase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asgenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for asgenera capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenera in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasms have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of asgenera capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenera may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amethavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with asgenera does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Typically, Amusase capsules are to be used along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver disease with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with an existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of agenerase and raitonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoioids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's disease and suppressive adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Loveatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of asgenera with Loveatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalized Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who take this medicine at the same time, asgenera may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amethavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given simultaneously with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if also low doses of raitonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity, due to the high propylene glycolin content of the Amusase, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenera should be removed in the duration of 5 when a rash of the skin is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including proteasehmer have been reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy was needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hammophilic patients (type A and B), which were treated with proteasehouses, reports of an increase of haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were especially reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width are not allowed simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines, whose active ingredients are predominantly confused with CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, undesired effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirror of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the amodynamite mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and check the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with amethavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, however, for cmax decreasing by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amethavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of amethavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily were applied to substantiate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduced if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amehavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amehavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amethavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study on the use of Agenerase in combination with Didanosin was carried out, however, it is recommended that didanosin and asgenera revenue fall apart at least one hour (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the gift of emfavirency in combination with amethavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with antifavirency in combination with amethavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasehmer would lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteasehmer and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amethavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is required, as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amethavir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous donation of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with asgenera, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenera in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fosampiavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase of cmax of ketoconazole in the plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69times compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without concurrent application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can potentially cause interdependency on CYP3A4 when used together with Amusase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasehmer it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenera, as it can result in resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva known as an enzyme reductor (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir may lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amethavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, niisoldipine, and Verapamil can 10 be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with asgenera can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranspal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous use of agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticosteroids, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Loveatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolic exchange is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as Amusase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this drug with amethavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilisation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while offering an amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agenerase should not be used along with oral midazolam (see section 4.3) while caution is required while using agenera with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if also low doses of raitonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at present, as the amprenavirus dosage is to be adjusted when amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">While offering warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenera, increased control of the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antiviral effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous donation of asgenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, however, it is not known whether amprenavir passes into breast milk with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the embedding in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenera was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the asgenera treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with the use of asgenera or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteaseheworms received 1200 mg of asgenera twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fatheral subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsal fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral unidentially-treated individuals who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients with 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients were observed in 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or lean-papular nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be aborted with amethavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of asgenera twice a day together with low-dose Ritonavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; one exception was increases of triglyceride and CPK values, which occurred in patients who received agenera together with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- polypromonstages with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both on acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of amethavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The correlation between the activity of HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosampiavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir, ooster treatment schemas with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral unidentially-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred by week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolation rate of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with proteaseheworms, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, I47V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I54L / M / T / V, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosampiavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: N = 107), patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following proteasehmer mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amethavir / ritonavir or Fosampiavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasehmer-resistant insulators.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosampiavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of amethavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasehmer-resistant insulators.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that dispel diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to ampere-avir creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross resistance between amehavir and other proteasehouses for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not-treated patients with whom a Fosampra avir- containing scheme failed (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (four out of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amehavir maintains its activity against some other proteasehmer-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which adults treated with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nuclear osidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenera, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis identified the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subsurface threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenera is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Aprase was examined three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with AGenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the benefits of "unbiased" asgenera should be considered in therapy optimization with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, however, for cmax decreasing by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amethavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food although the intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approx. 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume and an unobstructed penetration of amethavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amethnir that represents the active part remains probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosage interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason, drugs that induce or inhibit or inhibit the CYP3A4 or the CYP3A4 medium must be given with caution when given simultaneously with agenera (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The dosage of Asperase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amethnir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amethavir is 14% less bioavailable than capsules; therefore, Amusase Solution and Amusase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amehavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment regimens lead to amehavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amethavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amethavir of mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas appeared in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amethos.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use, there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, amethavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of asgenera nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals, which were treated at the age of 4, showed high mortality both in the control rooms and with the animals treated with amethavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus elongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24. if Asperase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asgenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for asgenera capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with low or slight liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalized Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Asgenera should be removed in the duration of 27 when a rash of the skin is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, however, for cmax decreasing by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amethavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amehavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amehavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amethavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with antifavirency in combination with amethavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasehmer would lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amethavir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with asgenera, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, niisoldipine, and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranspal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">While offering warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenera, increased control of the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antiviral effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by 22% resp.</seg>

<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the embedding in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asgenera was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both on acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of amethavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, amehavir maintains its activity against some other proteasehmer-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unbiased" asgenera should be considered in therapy optimization with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosage interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2098">The benefits of using Ritonavir "oosterter" AGenase solution for enrolment has not been proved either with PI pre-treated patients nor with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of ampere-avir as a solution to the intake is 14% lower than of Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Asperase capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Amusase Solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of Aprase, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amethavir is not deemed necessary, an application of AGenase can be contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycogen, AGenase is a solution for taking in infants and children under the age of 4, pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contraindicated in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair approach was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to patient complaints or because of the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there is currently no data on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experience, therefore the application of previously untreated tumors is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have a lower likelihood of responding to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratosis on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip supply.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data about the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis in anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in intensity throughout the therapy or go back after settling the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 lesions lower a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Despite the quantifiable level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml), neither after one-time nor after repeated topical use (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in related side effects in the studies involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of inclination (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and considered likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod-Cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of phase III are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-Cream, were in these studies a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials treated with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod-cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excretion / leaves / shed (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe shorage and caching (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies for investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were demonstrated after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was demonstrated that the efficacy in relation to a complete cure of the tendencies in Imiquimod over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the overall 119 patients who had treated Imiquimod, the cases were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in five-time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically verified individual primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that around 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a 25 cm2 large treatment area on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observational studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications outward tendencies, actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not generally occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks resp.).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of weight led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months to dermal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with more than three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for man due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with small UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratososes are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in case of flat actinic keratosis in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for infection with infected warts.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations earlier, please inform your doctor before starting treatment. o inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Use Aldara Cream only when the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucosa.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty of withdrawing the foreskin can be impeded with increased incidence of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have during the infection with incline warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you apply other medicines or have applied recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during the treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of inclination, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin place with the stilt warts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with stilt warts under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before using Aldara Creme?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately about it if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells may make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to get a blue stain sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas that you have applied Aldara Creme (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Mostly these are lighter skin reactions which resound in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, peeling, skin disorders, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes to the application site (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, scurf- and scarring), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogged nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mukopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalization equipment, and patients may require appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly investigating the safety of the drug, but its efficacy was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver size).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthropathy (in hands and feet), feeling of hotness, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check every new information that might be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme is used to monitor patients who receive Aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mukopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with durazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recovering facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction need to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions has to be cautious after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before beginning of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of an easy or medium-severe infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / imbuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular inclusion of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that have been exposed to laronidase via breast milk are present, it is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions reported in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 trial (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the Phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a seroconform within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patient in the age of 5 years with a severe form of stiffness usually occurred within one month for a servo-conversion (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 trial (or up to early departure from the study), there were no antibodies available in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never come to a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was observed in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions, even though the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the therapy of the enzyme is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substratum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated the placebo group to improve lung function and inability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically insignificant over this period and absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by the use of a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes summarized for five efficacy variables (expected percentages normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk test, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally observed in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with medium circulation).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased GAG- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were noted after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of trial (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental speed of development, whereas in older patients with severe trial form only limited or even no advances in cognitive development were to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, research on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens was carried out on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity in unique doses, toxicity in repeated use and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted before application and is intended for intravenous use (see information for doctors and medical personnel).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, is gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence for more than 1 out of 10 patients): • Headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disease, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • Sleeping • fever • Hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>

<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Determine the number of bottles to be diluted according to the body weight of each patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer), and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have previously not been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should receive corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (medicine for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose pattern of blood changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, lowered or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetric acid thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetric mixed into its active form is easier to equip cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural helioma, Alimta was studied in a major study on 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin passed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta for longer survival times than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0,9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of second-line treatment of patients with lung-kal advanced or metastatic non-celled bronchial carcinoma except for overwiev or epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the telemetraxed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALS 500 mg / m ² of KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the "telemetric" gift and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of telemetraxed, at least 5 doses of folic acid need to be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last telemetraxed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first dose of a telemetric acid and after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetric acid, a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under consideration of the Nadir's blood flow or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be applied as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above, there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients aged under 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adaptations were necessary for patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values from &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marcosuppression and telemetric mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils regain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet index has regained a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-chromatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetric acid must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactic measure for reducing treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylchloric acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with telemetric acid (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients receiving a telemetric therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-time for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetric mixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transellular space, a drainage of the effusion should be contemplated before telemetric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 predominantly cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with telemetric mixed, if this drug is commonly used in combination with another cytotoxic active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated vital substances (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible grading of reproductive ability is made by telemetric mixed, men should be advised against the treatment centre to seek advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to reduced telemetric acid excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advisable if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimally 2 days after therapy with telemetric acid can be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-value such as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with telemetric acid must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetric mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetric acid in pregnant women, but as with anti-fungal antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (telemetric) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetric acid acts as an antifolate with several attack points by blocking the thymidylatin synthase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymidin- and purinucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-centric, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of an overall survival of 2.8-months compared to those patients who were infected with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish yellow without compromising the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low-calorie, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients taking Alli and taking no weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can not break down some fats in the food, thereby causing about a quarter of the fats supplied with the food intact to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 overweight patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study of Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots at the anus, flatus (winch) with a bowel movement, stools, oily / oily stools, stools, flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (if not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or in cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Limited to transport Orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as Orlistat is only minimally resorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or renal function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the active substance or one of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Cholesterase • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich snack or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmacist prior to a therapy with alli, as the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-related measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in the event of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with concurrent application of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials for up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as beta-carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-off dose of Amiodarone, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid reformation of some of the systemic effects caused by the lipase inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect occurs in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine remnant of the gastrisch and pancreatic lipasties.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, it was estimated that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3,6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients who administered the minimal systemically resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after cleavage of the N-molyl-leucine group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alohxi is applied in chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroid (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for Aloxi re-circulation throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alohxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in case of severely emitted chemotherapy, due to a cancer disease and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required while offering Palonosetron with medicines that prolong the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, Doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetical analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Chinidine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of using Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be associated with alohxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effective relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed because of the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alopxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 dioxorubicin and 250 micrograms or 750 mcg of palonosetron were given intravenously intravenously in day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving strongly emitted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 mcg palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of I.V. induced palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous dosage an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous use of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total textual position (AUC0- ∞) achieved once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after one-time intravenous dosage; however, the cmax was 0.75 mg higher after disposing.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro diagnostics, CYP2D6 has shown that CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was rediscovered within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unmodified drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous intravenous retinal detachment, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination diet and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Early clinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every day over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is assessed as low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the renunciation of the drug was recommended for the treatment of the drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU (also called "drug products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood standard are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that substantiate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again flamed up in more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study included in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the question to what extent the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected firs (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not act against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should consult the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients with placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in wounds, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stained cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Ltd. for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointments carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans following topical application on skin or infected surface wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether to continue / stop breastfeeding or to continue the therapy with Altargo should be considered between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo used, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was at the date of administration that concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site is involved with the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptides, some of which block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin in at least some infection forms appear to be questionable, consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine, Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days of topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake was 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition (cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity on rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which resulted in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 removal skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the commercialized product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the permissions is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the GMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP will be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point show that you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment goes out of view on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be brought to an end by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix, or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by helping the immune system (the body's natural immune system), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the virus and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the Vaccine received since 1996, and the vaccine approved since 1997 is the Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month period between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primers with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis B antibodies (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are found in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination require a canticide as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the use of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360-ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, under certain circumstances no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody value is reached, so that in these cases the dosage of other vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccine, these injection practices should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can however be injected exceptionally subcutaneously, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular pertus-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mum- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it may be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thiomeric and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccindoses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants between the ages of 12 and 15, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on the basis of a calculation basis per Vaccine Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix with 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39,1% in the subjects after the dosage of a dose of 3-dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to per tape (i.e. over the whole vaccine-cycle with 39.6% of the subjects that got ambient) compared to 36.2% in the subjects, who received the 3-dose Combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and dexterity was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study for 1- and 11-year-olds the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form-induced hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per tape, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinants, which reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine scheme with ambition or during the 3-dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at Impflingen between 1 and 15 years, the anti-HAV rates were 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs seroconversion rates were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was conducted between 12- and 15-year olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher compared with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were reached in a clinical trial study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinants received either a 2-dose-vaccination scheme with amyloid or a 3-dose-vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of primers, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of form-ininhibited Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, it was demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6- months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time as a combination of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, acellular pertus-, inactivated poliomyelia and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix is not fully protected from infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus, even though the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is infected with hepatitis-A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses, (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine, vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the second vaccination is commonly prescribed).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you vaccination protection against the termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defense, or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking additional medicines (including those who can get you without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / has been given / received or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated on separate areas and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not administered to pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have become known for placing the first allowance for the placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was only placed in traffic in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete encephalopathy or hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonija is - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading conduit) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonija can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste problems or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "ammonesaps were" "" "" "" "approved" "" "" "" "under" exceptional circumstances "" "" "" "" because, due to the rarity of the disease, only limited information was available for this medicine at the time of admission. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzymes already manifests itself in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late maniac form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), an indication for use occurs when a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMIENPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early-maniac defect of carbamylphosphate synthase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk for the origination of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">It should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal failure, as well as with sodium retention and odema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are carried out via the liver and the kidneys, AMIENPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal increase was slowed down and the loss of neurons increased.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturing of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMIENPS at 56% of the patients at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AMIENPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with Lakesazidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms come from the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dosages of neurotoxicity in an intravenous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active metabolic compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylalanine which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylalanine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylalanine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylmercury-glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is commenced immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always a fist, and the disease led to death even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of the year.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative methods of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and had already been treated before the first appearance of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornicap transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonic encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrin is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylalanine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism, and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous use of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cyclamen or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in plasma can be detectable in the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylalanine through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat in the case of toxic and non-toxic doses had no causal effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMBIA granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets or patients with difficulty swallowing) or over a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early-maniac defect of carbamylphosphate synthase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMBIA granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the pyramid cells of the cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with Lakesazidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylalanine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylalanine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylalanine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that, for each gram, the sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylgluten-glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulate form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, it can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out with you, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMBIA, as sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMORGPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken before, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not use AMPS, as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disorders, omission of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating a corresponding treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMORGPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood pattern (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, nausea, constipation, unpleasant Hautgeruch, skin rash, kidney function disorders, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You can no longer use AMORGPS according to the expiry date specified on the box and the container after "Use until" the expiry date specified.</seg>
<seg id="2874">As AMORGPS looks and content of the package AMPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMBIA, as sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you take AMORGPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken before, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMORGPS distributed on the same single doses orally or via a gastric fistula (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (tube that is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Remove from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granules. • Put a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equal to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoons granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (cardiac attack) (an abnormal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients applying a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of Angiox was compared with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI, patients frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or reascularisation).</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in relation to all indicators except for heavy bleeding in which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other miludine or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the intra-market of Angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in further succession, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolus dose of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a certain bolus-administration of Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT concentrations, the reformed and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the stun dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, the second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which resulted in admission, the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with an average dose of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intravenous administration of non-fractional Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against miludine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when they are administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most hemorrhages occur in PCI patients at arterial point positions, patients who undergo a perkutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalent studies, monitoring of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bivalirudin reaches the level existing before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte Aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In each case, the clinical and biological haemostaseparameters can be checked regularly in the combination of bivalent traces with platelet inhibitors or anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are inadequate in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the bivalent group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding alone significantly less often occurred than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidruid plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the bivalent group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped together according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalent blood is immediately terminated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombocyte inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and in the anion binding region of thromboin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a serum of patients with serum showed no thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thromblosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalent studies show a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proven by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was carried out in the following cases, an additional bolero of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before starting angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2) are presented in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a perkutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Bivalirudin is expected to undergo catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent revalescence of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the division of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminalen sequence by thromboin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombine.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm, or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for controlling glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or can not effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin ulisine differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where the body can not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin pulses.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the ingredient, the brand (here-), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinced, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulin they use and can therefore change during the switching of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which increase blood sugar-lowering activity and amplify the tendency to hypoglycemia belong to oral antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrin, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylin, propoxyphene, salicylic and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, among the effects of sympathetics such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpin the symptoms of the adrenergic counter regulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin ulisins occur in human breast milk, but in general, insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed the adverse drug restrictions known from clinical studies grouped according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is omitted to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or treated by a doctor through intravenous use of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a stroke injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA-, the response occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin ulisin in the therapeutic-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin ulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin ulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postpranational glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin ulisisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranational control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin ulisins are turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, just like with a human normal insulin which is given 2 minutes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin ulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) was given before a meal 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin ulisine at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
