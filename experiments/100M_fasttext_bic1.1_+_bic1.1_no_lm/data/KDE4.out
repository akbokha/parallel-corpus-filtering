the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map file tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of default settings from the k@@ de package ; add@@ ons . please note that some more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; icon ; see Extras cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cr@@ ashes if available .
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras pane filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory with different types of filters .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps permit the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected , even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ emap diagram a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only when sufficient space is present or if the area of child rectangular rec@@ tan@@ gles can be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps display algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . frames are drawn to display the ne@@ sting of the entries , and that frames require space that is then no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square .
how partition the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoi@@ dance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ rent branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View Add to Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ set entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the Image Gallery module can be found in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; View picture gallery ... or with C@@ TR@@ L ; I .
when you visit the Image Gallery module , a dialog box opens , which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
the option Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .

although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all , programs is also &amp; digi@@ p@@ ments ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; attempts to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all necessary information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . that is , users and developers are helping each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; then we would like you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ came ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ came ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data base is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ came ; you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ ti@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ came ; views every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be altered .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; En@@ jo@@ ys recur@@ sively the library path across its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ tag don &apos;t have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ plug ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help menu help .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ came ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the camera then appears as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , extension software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see preview images or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugin Interface Project ( Hand@@ book ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ bat@@ ches ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ stepped ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctrl + Shift + F .
moving and removing images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields indicated in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ ename only works if this ind is displayed as the symbol view . which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ bian settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ came are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose this album Import Photos . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the destination album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move it to the destination album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set is used to sort your photos when you select from the toolbar or view albums Go to the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the collections for collections .
the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons oldest , average , ne@@ sts : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the album . to do so , the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information is first tried . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ came ; open , the first image is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview &amp; quot ; . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying glass buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you must wait for a short while while the preview images are generated . this allows you to avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is available , you can change settings digi@@ came ; set up the albums page and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse po@@ inter for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such help window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can access all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ . you can select all the functions associated with &amp; digi@@ . you can choose between viewing images , sli@@ deshow or editing images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... . image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . the applications listed there are managed by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ plug ; Del@@ ete , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Del If you prefer to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My dates list quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search again .
when one keyword is selected , all photos associated with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ pop@@ up , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can be only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use key words , you must first mark your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to add with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; drag and drop there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails of the pictures and select cue from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear below the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just need to click on the bottom rectangle of the box to indicate the time unit .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection , which will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
next he search box is a small lamp that gets green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if The search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criterion . after you have been saved it appears filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . the text box Save Search as will be used to select a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection once again , you will need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form will return to the search information entered previously . if you select Add as Advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . for more information , see The Advanced Search Tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete search from the context menu .
advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ p@@ r &apos;s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . all rules are added by line by operators , enum@@ er@@ ated . one option can be added to this list with search group / delete group . each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... At least , you can create Search of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ came ; each picture character@@ izes by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by means of a disk , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand colour sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ came ; find the right images . also here a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive tool search tool based on the Marble miniature program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides a lighting console in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl ; L Add Fol@@ lowing Table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window will be opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ p@@ r , you can quickly open the lighting table with L Tools .
from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview synchronization from the toolbar and execute zoo and move operations on one of the pictures , then they will be executed in the other image as well . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate from the toolbar , then the first two pictures are automatically loaded into the field for comparing . now use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies the work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions work directly from the lighting table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lighting table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to piv@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold down the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode Preview , then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are the same in the preview mode .
digital stock management exam@@ ines each part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . we focus on the procedures for digital fot@@ ograph@@ ers the &amp; digi@@ came ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , categ@@ ori@@ ze , backup , optimize , wait and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transform@@ es , assem@@ bles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is according to your definition data , which provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a certain photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use sure not &amp; digi@@ came ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the remaining photos will organize on the basis of your date . if you do enough photos then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can later save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Album from the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which one ? added &amp; digi@@ came ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value .
let &apos;s now talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are processed by &amp; digi@@ came ; updated as it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ a @-@ data inter@@ s@@ ect . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to it then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Major quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an in@@ scription on its own .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as labelling . K@@ DE can even set it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE can even export your images to web galleries . so , you will have to tell the story for the publication no second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ ocation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical data . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth . however , you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples for this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be filled out as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the vendor drop to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency will provide the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they have no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the picture , digital water@@ marks . for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ came ; in the near future there will be a module for batch processing .
topics : disk failure , plate failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , cad@@ a@@ emia , lifetime , temperature , data size , disper@@ sed super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to mistakes , even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for formatt@@ ing and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they filter by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of cor@@ rupted disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data back to check it . also , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then transfer to a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disc@@ laim@@ ers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives on this subject : Disk@@ Info
in a nut@@ shell : discs do the longest if they are operated at temperatures from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is S@@ MAR@@ T . some of the errors stated by S@@ MAR@@ T her@@ ald the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are particularly read errors and rel@@ ocation counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electricity , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoi@@ dable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . remember , however , that not every connector strip also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , please ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ oter , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for lap@@ tops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ volt@@ ages , these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power out@@ age occurs . this gives you the option to store your data and to shut down the system . if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of current dis@@ rup@@ tions with the costs to avoid this . high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than € 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . moreover , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed storage in the offer .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs is at least secure the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebooks and 46 % on work@@ station systems . with not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a loss of data every year . so back up your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster pro@@ phyla@@ xis always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Saf@@ egu@@ arding : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ator .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time when such a backup is made . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sc@@ anned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase the security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lu@@ tion should be done manually after you have done a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC information stored in the image file , retained X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing devices , ... , use of the internet .
in order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and rate new over time . unfortunately , there is no other way to keep a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . however , every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with the plan and you want to enlarge the area you want to grow on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollars ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ it ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can be much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for an improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that it requires relatively many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression .
TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obli@@ ges to use metadata . a hand@@ ful of camera manufacturers already makes DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some time .
this may be one of the reasons why since 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the met@@ a file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of purposes and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert the raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a subtle editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes cut off by the other programs .
protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only then export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; in the Adding a Photos to an album you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturer Note , GPS etc . this information is the same as for the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ stepped ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected download button is checked until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ came ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
when you download the All or download selected folders , a dialog will show you to select the destination album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed , as normal folders are sorted . you can read the list of existing albums in the My albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you must select them first and then delete selected delete selected .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully put into a &amp; digi@@ p@@ ; album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera completely , you should do this about the camera view , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording @-@ series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another date format as the default format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option Date and Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in capital letters if you prefer .
the new fil@@ ename , which &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you do not let &amp; digi@@ came ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , you can automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is finished , &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and latitude and can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ came ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data in the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ra@@ iler and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . right with the right hardware , about re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and finally over the manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in the g@@ px format , since this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and of the GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool of Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the signs of ha@@ v@@ red coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ g@@ le.com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to give you so much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; change . to access these settings , you need to select the settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing should be set . thus , you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ stepped ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields during a database synchronization .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author @-@ line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this allows the metadata to be permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ came ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ . imported without going lost .
image cap@@ tions as embedded scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows you to read your let@@ tering from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse po@@ inter is in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ came ; album folder that has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ stepped ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lighting console &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lighting console these settings are switched on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; can only be used on fast machines . if you have one then you can obtain better view results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image editing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling refers to the fact that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data needs more time for getting out and packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality as the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
if you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image editing was only one image viewer for photos . at the moment , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default value is that all green pixels are the same . if the sc@@ rolling green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top light , so the parts of your pictures that are burned , as a result of the in@@ ability of your camera to look at the top lights as a continuous white . use the setting through white in the settings . the setting colors release some unusual results as it indicates the top light in various ros@@ at@@ os . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; lum@@ bar ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
when you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ stepped ; image processing can be made . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo@@ s icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub @-@ raw data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reproduction .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was used for me and the paper used by myself . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color so@@ fter correction since it is performed during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other so that colors are as exact as possible .
behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Place the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera man and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself .
there are more options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors hence very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; nbsp ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; nbsp ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and then they will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ came ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn off the metadata that is displayed at the bottom of the images during ad .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Auto detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , powered on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / parameters to mount your camera .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ stepped ; setting a photo in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes caused by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly performed by &amp; digi@@ stepped ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button Change .
you can also display and digi@@ p@@ ate the display of the welcome screen ; this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ came under certain circumstances ; .
the setup Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ came ; searching the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ came , you asked if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be made in &amp; digi@@ . use to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; includes quick image editing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see S@@ etting Up the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image editing will change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save file or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button on the Edit button . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last storage .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can und@@ o you by modi@@ fying or restor@@ ing editing by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should re@@ vert the short@@ cuts , Ctrl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o Ctrl ; Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back @-@ back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl , mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the context menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar can be displayed . if you do not want this , you can do this in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ stepped ; you can view it from &amp; digi@@ came ; see the section for setting up the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select from the File Image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or complete sets . entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Print Assistant from the Album Export . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
in the label view , you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size . note the text below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database , but you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the Assessment section displays an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the key short@@ cut Ctrl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field gency . the coding follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with previously used keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . thus , you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords for a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword ID .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword Filter section .
the page bar keyword filtering is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the inter@@ section of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with Ctrl + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created it and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . then the options look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you insert a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable departure from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours that you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , then everyone would like to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow fulfil@@ ls all six criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB requires that your ; on@@ it@@ or is calli@@ br@@ ated . if you work as a s@@ RGB color space , you need either to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alization , S@@ ame , Automatic S@@ ame and Con@@ tr@@ ast Enh@@ anced from the Cor@@ rec@@ ate Automatic correction program automatically attempt to make the best from your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
the same : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous intensity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity scale is as flat as possible . it sometimes results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces g@@ arbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
bro@@ aden contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a re@@ configuration of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will fail .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color White Balance of Image Processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left you will see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original whit@@ ep@@ aper , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow tuning lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colours if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter Colour Management .
another important tool is available in the menu under Color Cor@@ rection Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same correction and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar stabil@@ isation , also called sab@@ ati@@ cal , was an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and afterwards inver@@ ted the development of the image . the coloured , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an up@@ turned revers@@ ed color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as heavily saturated colors are too much for those who barely see landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting entries you can look at in the preview .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all the changes you perform can be previ@@ ewed . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool change correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the scope explained here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be previ@@ ewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most commonly used . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma read@@ ings .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values . for example , the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is visible in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later . for that purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means , and sun@@ shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjusting input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and dar@@ ken the corresponding image pixel .
on the preview of the original image you will see a red mark . if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , mid@@ - and sun@@ shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curves .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color shade of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors Channel Mixer of Image Processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are also using the option Mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour space consists of small space art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color shower first .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any mixer setting can be saved and loaded for later . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the Option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture can be seen at ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your possibility of abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 cr@@ un@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
s@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of the ble@@ aching of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ia filter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper of texture has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the image trans@@ forms with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce trans@@ forms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , back@@ sp@@ illed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool To cut the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a formatt@@ ed text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been stored , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply the template template you can put a template on a picture .
the Image template menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . you must however take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ came ; simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your st@@ encil file using the Fol@@ der button in dialog . select the folder where you copied the templates . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after setting the root folder for templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder will be displayed . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works more psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process paints colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges to become a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more consec@@ ration than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of shar@@ p@@ ness already while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you get the control over your image .
in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the Shar@@ pen@@ ing Factory Def@@ ault . you can use the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ y to call Shar@@ es .
you should handle this carefully , as the results do not seem very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . generally , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image slightly soft@@ ly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to soft@@ mark with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ bl@@ ur@@ able mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount sets the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image to be added to the original . this will set the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filters . in this way areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focusing an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . you can start it from the menu by starting colors re@@ focusing in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the g@@ auss &apos; folding . the g@@ auss &apos; folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also on the source pix@@ el@@ es that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , FI@@ R &apos;s in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ness effect of the module .
noise Filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will poll@@ ute the image even further .
g@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter if your uncle@@ ar gauge is &apos; sch . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed un@@ sharpen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the die size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the shar@@ p@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for that parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much of the operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave nasty arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king using a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically speaking , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear Filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smooth@@ ness regul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of the area that was dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ parall@@ eled art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default options as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default options are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use tab Gl@@ ue and Advanced Settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions , and details are sharp . a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that sharpen@@ ing should always be subordin@@ ated to direction dependen@@ cy .
directional dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD h@@ iss , a high value produces wav@@ y similar patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise exists , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . be sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to ski@@ p it .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove picture errors with minor art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact created during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. of dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial in English .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny smo@@ ker that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ windows details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can stay with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor errors are cleared .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter looking forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ating occur again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
light D@@ ens@@ ity : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that controls the details .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that controls the details .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more strongly rough@@ ed up .
atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . lu@@ ck@@ ily , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to mark soft@@ ness with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restor@@ ing gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ting , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the Stop button .
below you can reduce like a photo with reduced noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ting on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were used to reduce to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner light and the photo paper . the original picture can be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove pixels from photos that were with a CCD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode , since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ photo extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button Dunkel@@ bild . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you take the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the last dark image and automatically loads it again in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you correct the result inside the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel p@@ eg@@ s . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large picture format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the iris filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should , even with center filters , use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise bl@@ ur effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale implem@@ entations of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter .
with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous intensity and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion of second degree . with negative values t@@ onn@@ en@@ oid distortion can be corrected and positive values c@@ is@@ sen@@ uniform distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the reverse mark of the parameter .
zoom : this value scales the image size and causes a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image res@@ izes .
bri@@ ghten : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ed or c@@ is@@ sing correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . the best way to perform this correction is the first one . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a t@@ int correction , the effect would appear to be the wrong effect .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a c@@ is@@ sing distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform@@ ers Cut box from the image editing or via the Zoom Controller of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ oid correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ting and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ular@@ ity if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ting and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter bl@@ ends colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a sort of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Fil@@ tr@@ ation filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ting on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ting effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the applied film sensitivity con@@ forms to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; oil painting filter creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side viewed , the hing@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined part is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ b@@ age . images whose gra@@ dients slowly change are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sk@@ etch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter engraving defines your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Fil@@ ters engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ e@@ forms 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by blocks of glass .
wav@@ e@@ forms 2 : analog to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the image is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to comp@@ ute and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a revol@@ ving camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by horizontal moti@@ ons of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or a train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ening bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos , or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ly sharpen@@ ing : bl@@ urs the image by a random displacement of the pixels and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to comp@@ ute and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button .
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it into the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools for this can be found in the Transform@@ ers Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ers menu .
photo bu@@ bbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm which is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . choose this transformation size change in menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with better quality , then try to blow up the tool .
many imaging programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise exists , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly . each st@@ abling for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo bu@@ bbles is very fast on what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button .
you can see below an example of photo bu@@ bbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to trim a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rectangle . you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut away . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rectangle . you can create a new rectangle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the editing button of the editing pane in the toolbar and the photo will be trimm@@ ed ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the Preview pane , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain intact .
in the tool To cut aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
the tool To cut the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the range for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are saved in the EX@@ IF @-@ tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly assistance make it possible to help you to make your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division divided into various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 3@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 and etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden centre .
the golden centre provides li@@ que@@ fied help lines when putting together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve . compared to the third gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without direc@@ ting the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ section points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to do this transform Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees again . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point in the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after fil@@ ming a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Transform@@ ers C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed for a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adap@@ ting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to trim the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
the tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , a horizontal shift will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram .
sh@@ ears your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sh@@ atter horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you press on default settings , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line will be displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ utter@@ ing creates twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ers C@@ utting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ . .
because of this dependen@@ cy from other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all the file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats that you know . this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ came ; the file in the image processing is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ p@@ v ; accepts . in the configuration section you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter &amp; digi@@ came ; in the configuration section you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the Dave Coff@@ in web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ came ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short movies . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ came ; is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in capabilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ came ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start the program for playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting entries with the White Balance Module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ came ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools like Shar@@ es , Charac@@ ter@@ istics , Noise Re@@ duction , re@@ focus , Un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper part shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and down . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive tool search tool based on the Marble miniature program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; nbsp ; can be applied either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; nbsp ; Settings and hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color beside it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let View . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for sel@@ ections . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is enabled under the Color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ diagram Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include graph@@ s . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ diagram Viewer project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ diagram Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; unique ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph is in &amp; unique ; the graph@@ ene is re@@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; works ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ ; in one &amp; unique ; -@@ component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ GUI viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graph@@ s .
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ diagram ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ ; uploaded file has been modified from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your choice later , you can use the Settings k@@ screen viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ screen viewer , and eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ app@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it to the setup dialog .
upon program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using several pages , you can choose to fit the parts of the graph , which come to a page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ s distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut shop page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ ; when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time a graph is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ . you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or specify to be requested at each start .
the context menu normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up further options :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z and layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ l@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ finished graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ le model layout for un@@ finished graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man pure gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multiple grid trigger for treating large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the no@@ des in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wi@@ ese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directional or un@@ finished ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ finished graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module read images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the san@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you open the Image File menu , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values of duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window appears to specify the options of the image file . please remember that the type BMP does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create it by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import - &gt; screen@@ shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select The Complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you chose the complete desktop read only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

if you select the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ ten@@ tion : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization module provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above dialog appears . in order to perform a possible correlation about time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . this file contains , of course , data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the time zone must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is included , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the difference in time of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button correlation to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the respective region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Inclu@@ de this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the Ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the selection allows you to select all the albums to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer , &amp; eg ; Sk@@ ill show
the Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will be saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Rider for preview images , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can read the program messages to see if errors during the generation have occurred . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as turning , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after startup , an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss @-@ free module is a tool to modify images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below listed actions , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is rising , since no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ ten@@ tion : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently does not have documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you can select the destination image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the sli@@ deshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for your slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD Player .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ as@@ au . then you can start the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the sli@@ deshow if you are back again .
if a note appears that encoding or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right below .
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original trem@@ ble from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera vendor . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now read@@ just the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sing .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ processing : prepar@@ es the image for photographic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size , and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are attached as attachments .
do not make sure to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails sent . it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format under the Menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG File Format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original exc@@ itation data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . you can close this window with the C@@ lose button .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the sli@@ deshow will be very slow .
the option fil@@ ename option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
between the images , the temp@@ oral distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects that you can choose between . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during sli@@ deshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ ten@@ tion : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Back@@ ground image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have finished your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , there are now entries in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press people with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person you will only see the images on which both of them are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for each person a separate preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view pictures next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
you must however choose which picture to display for each individual person . in order to do this , you need to open the image view window ( in closer detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; launch demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name implies , this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline lets you use the following ways inter@@ actively : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time values . if you select a range , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; photovoltaic ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the dup@@ licate and a description that the HTML file should contain later on . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages , see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you want to create a photovoltaic / photo album ; an export file is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages , so you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you must select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser is started after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings below have all three related to base folders or URLs . a sub @-@ folder will be created in this folder whose name will be set to the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time collecting the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can share all the images and pass that file as independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is the dialog for export@@ ing images that you can call through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with option Man@@ ually copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Autom@@ atically copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this anyway , just select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can say that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the import@@ ing wiz@@ ard consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to copy the import pictures .
it may be that you specify the category persons to the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called persons . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step , you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , over ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want them .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use it in future Star@@ ts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
using the Settings k@@ photo@@ album menu item , you can access a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the various settings options explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can view by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up full members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be accessed through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; nbsp ; but are distributed separately . however , most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; nbsp ; only very little . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures . Demo database can be used either via command line with command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between photo album and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications put their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that the picture preview currently shows you .
in addition to the current album , a list of albums must be handed over to the modules . here is a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category persons , you will be doing a photo album , so do so if you selected persons to view them and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a new photo album with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window that you can browse through your image database . in the section , we will return to this window , but now click on the images to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons you see in the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures is illustrated by Jes@@ per and all images were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to move the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are m@@ apped , you can find that the names used are moved up , locate the persons more quickly and classi@@ fy them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting after date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . in order to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . see this step in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images if you don &apos;t set a filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
when you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; even use pictures without having you saved on the hard drive . of course , you must have saved the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can get in the database index ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not saved on the hard drive . for example , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the preview images are present so that you can preview these pictures . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy and re @-@ copy files from the folders . &amp; nbsp ; do not yet support you to insert the relevant CD . so if you want to avoid anno@@ ying about how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click on Current View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also navigate all the images that your little sister is allowed to see and lock the menu item All but up @-@ to @-@ date view .
so you have set what images should be hidden in case of case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as an un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to help those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the reason why you want to manage all your pictures with a photo album ; manage and spend hours about hours so you want to describe it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason has a photo album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available right @-@ clicking on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and forth by using the keys image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide . &amp; nbsp ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus . start and stopped the sli@@ deshow by pressing Ctrl ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is easy to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can zoom in and out . to zoom in , you can easily zoom in with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the point @-@ key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the MO@@ Option the zo@@ oms sets so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that start and zoom in with the plus and minus key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the picture . at the moment you can break the preview and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to mark only the picture and view other pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer will give you the opportunity to see images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
if you have any features placed on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you want to edit , print , or whatever you have selected , just add all the images you have selected . then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the display view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed to color photo album ; on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your painted afterwards .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to close the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ al views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all subjects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Pa@@ ste menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene using del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User Docum@@ entation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL @-@ user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view .
press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ category element . if you only want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visual level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . Objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as required . you can also store multiple window configurations and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cards pointing up in the views .
the last possible window layout is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the drop down bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the bar . to prevent the closure , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window layout . it will display a dialog where you can store the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the rendering icon rendering the rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item view scene render .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View of render modes ... choose the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but makes sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small part of the picture , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality of combination , you can select the properties which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è sample or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique means super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is again and again divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which can be followed individually and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is creating noise for the beam process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import File menu ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when import@@ ing , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; ren@@ ders a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your retention and the version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example , height field data ) in paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ braries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values produce a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you tick high level of detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , if the camera uses an expanded projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives better approxim@@ ation for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can modify existing windows orders or create new window classi@@ fications . in the window classi@@ fications section explains how to create and store windows orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window system : displays all existing windows orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window layout when starting the program .
the list of existing window classi@@ fications shows all existing windows orders . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you will anchor the window under the existing window , with map map you get a card map view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert any light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit menu item .
the wi@@ re@@ frame view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the scene view from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or press the Enter key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( paste infinite body qu@@ ad ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the Object Tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can un@@ fold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter the pigment settings . therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities , but now take the simpl@@ est .
if you do not see any color on the header and ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then open the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Single . select this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the Object Tree , select each time colour and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to apply the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , since you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as colour :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Solid Color and set the values as below :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the settings for gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog impact . thus , the scene is processed pixel by pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered is needs some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected when you have finished editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cut keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands pres@@ et with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
opens a dialog to set the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a dump map is a way to pret@@ end rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ rac@@ tion on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
base bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ il@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for displaying .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can set if any image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for your browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the remain@@ der of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , loading &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full@@ screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; Cu@@ Be Show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
set the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until it is ab@@ orted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field .
click here to change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; Cu@@ dd@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for your browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

increases the image by 10 % . the factor per@@ tains to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Cu@@ Be Show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the entry field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; nbsp ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ came ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of &amp; digi@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user helps his part to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for entering the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give you so much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that modify the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; there are many options that you need to set up in the menu S@@ etting Photo ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the sub@@ exposed or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be in contrast with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a light color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar on the right , providing you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view them where you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make any more scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer do than scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving , or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before saving them .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel is &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview matches the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? s will result in a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not requested by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images store . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save As option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , the folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numerical su@@ ff@@ ix which will be counted every time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the G@@ PL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane @-@ library used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; under LG@@ PL . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the G@@ PL with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Glob@@ ale keyboard short@@ cuts . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select short@@ cuts with the right mouse button in the player window .
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function might break &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Rescue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure switches the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script itself needs to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change Sig@@ ni@@ fies that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume Sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub @-@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths contain the path to the selected files of the playlist if a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add a custom entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M is sent to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file per@@ missions :
when your script package is complete , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki scripts Page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag and drop music into the playlist , instead of working through endless menus . you may also search for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to re@@ experience your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
some of the comp@@ iler options must be certain dependen@@ cies so that they can be used . see System Requirements section for details .
enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will also turn on or off the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting @-@ bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches on the experimental function of the m@@ oods @-@ bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
tuning files with music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s preferences folder ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when moving , stores the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use ; relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing parts causes the playlist window to open / un@@ roll to keep the track always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the piece to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using Select In@@ to Fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player windows and context @-@ browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection for foreg@@ round and background color .
continue playback at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , the playback will automatically continue with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is selected , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors will give you the option to customize the O@@ SD colours for font and background . a click on the color faces opens the dialog for selecting colors . if your own colors are not checked , the default colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to specify the screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to display the O@@ SD .
the Audio Output memory card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers will activate even more setting options in this card card .
the map file collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; adds all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
the Collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under Port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card file provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved to the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , for example , flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can find the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok used are compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ . shut@@ down when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically in case of a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ in@@ fos but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ play / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the toolbar effects are easily removed . note that in some cases up to three times you have to click a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are easiest by using an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for troubleshooting . please enter only one error , if you are interested in solving a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the surface , the Start window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove From the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s that simple : - )
in the playlist toolbar , right next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click it .
you probably lack the program x@@ mms @-@ config . install the package x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ doc@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach so the actual question must be what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 decoder with the default ( for patent legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device needs to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( for example , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a de@@ bit with little overhead . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound Server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less support the visu@@ alis@@ ations react . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . run the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ asp@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download Open ff@@ m@@ peg first , compile and install it . then run all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the gst @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run svn update . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will be wo@@ ken by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user thei@@ re username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of Ctrl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returns .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what does the icon in the control bar look like ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what then ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ grams MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play the Audio CD from the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , percentage statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual valuation has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , i.e. by clicking the piece with the right button of the mouse and edit : select the evaluation or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings Tool@@ bar ... and take the required changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click on Create New Design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok from the drop down menu .
Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please see the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of cr@@ ashes and a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile those output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that the development files are installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How to fix it ?
your version of G@@ stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ stre@@ amer without pr@@ elo@@ ading . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the present to handle the present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , even though the module g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the present to handle the current &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok settings ... Output audio output to the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix tool , disable m@@ map bit@@ es on sound@@ card .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may , of course , take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the Wizard Assistant , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection subsequently , or simply not like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection will make it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the playlist of the playlist . you will find this button in the playlist toolbar .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is in the folder of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select the Ac@@ tions Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running track or the current stream . just below is the range , playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zers by clicking the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the scroll display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the play buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or the previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you tick the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions terri@@ fy you are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays different information about the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub @-@ window will be om@@ itted . the information presented here is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras / Statistics ) .
the sub@@ windows music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z @-@ symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the image file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context @-@ browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourites of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can specify which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try downloading the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required to do so .
the Find button opens a search for goo@@ g@@ le.com according to the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res will be ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged by performer and below it will be a further split after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists .
group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - S@@ orted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Gen@@ re / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them by interpre@@ ter .
group@@ ing Gen@@ re / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folder . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the toolbar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter you will find a selection box , which allows you to filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours to a year . you can also select your entire collection , so that the filter is practically shut down .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection Browser gives you the following options .
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry will give you the same effect .
set the pieces in queu@@ e - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer the pieces to the media player in the queu@@ e for transmission . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / Burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the list - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in various interpre@@ ters .
lift up list - change a album marked as a list back to a normal album . the album will then no longer be displayed under various performers , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling with many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelligent play@@ lists are also possible . click &apos; Add Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Under@@ window media player is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpre@@ ter sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the Interpre@@ t list . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the disk connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , enter / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
when the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be hard to attach files by simply dro@@ pping . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be useful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist covers all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separated search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ets : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field are looking for , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries you want . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist toolbar can be found at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions . on the left you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore any changes to the playlist .
a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer is located in the center of the toolbar . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Configuration .
there are many other buttons available for toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking twice in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu you can access &amp; Amar@@ ok settings .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the Visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry contains a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the Cover Management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select :
the queu@@ e administration received your big suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queu@@ e , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece in the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these later ) .
re@@ plen@@ ishes your playlist with random items from your entire collection and adds other random items during playback .
add tracks based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ itch ) . this mode requires some pieces to be in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window , or right @-@ click on you and then select Lo@@ ading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one .
the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix instantly fill in your playlist and you can immediately start playback . the Recommen@@ ded tun@@ es will be added to your collection at least one piece , so your playlist will be added at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button will empty the current playlist and add new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist will allow you to click Edit . as a result , a dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed after setting the songs .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist by each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have selected .
some scripts enable their own settings . you can customize the settings by running the script and then clicking on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok script scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . then click the script to delete it then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization @-@ Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start tells you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to follow the steps you need to install &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get a worse quality when encoding the MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy @-@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps you need to install &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , where you can get feedback there , draw on community help from the forums and learn news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions , which also sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio Decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . for example , with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mix@@ up CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ ename . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what should happen , as if you called the C@@ lose file .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the dialog &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the Burn dialog can only open if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described about what is the right mouse button ( available via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multiple session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it &apos;s more likely to be used for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dial@@ ogs is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the content . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ us * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired instantly by pressing the Burn button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog window typically appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and trim black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents are displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the table of contents allows selection and drag@@ ging of files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key layout further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b device wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges can be required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; nbsp ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more comfortable K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the included programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all the &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void chan@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void chan@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void chan@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can generate a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void shi@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List ur@@ ls , Q@@ String ) ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CDs ; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many coding encoding these WAV files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved into wa@@ v files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or in other formats like los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ default ( for OGG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything by yourself . however , only the encoding packages must be installed which are needed . if e.g. FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ er@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoi@@ ds protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanics of copy protection . just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only has to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding software is installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually captured .
this is only a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB query of CD data according to the set @-@ up of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default . note that previously the encoder in the encoder settings tab was configured in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is chosen to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the mode of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ps ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with different cards ( such as En@@ coder , En@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; that might be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can re@@ play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may now have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to OGG with lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo devices . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR Common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for the music of adolescents , portable devices and auto@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or automatically retri@@ eved through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the counter must be added by l@@ ame and the title Parameter from &amp; k@@ audio creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download the information rather than enter it into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note that the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being inf@@ lic@@ ted on the &amp; CD ; however , the information without the CD ; any more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( f@@ ake ) address than the one used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know it more precisely .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done .
to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined encoder . more information about the encoder is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
you have to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each CD .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card file General settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card board CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop down sel@@ ector is simpler , a &amp; CD entry is found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls command the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol usually is open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously sufficient pieces : exc@@ use , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; ej@@ ected after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / has to specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if only space is available on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be hidden to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : at a dual core or Quad core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted to en@@ code more than a wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was compiled in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will be retri@@ eved . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed , just like in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for the questions and answers in the section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and also the name of the artist and the album is shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the remain@@ der of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments on the line , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the coding Settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Core Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
Tags are not supported by all coding and file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the web@@ page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the row with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the part list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are read . a simple click on the row turns on or off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click the Sel@@ ection button to read the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with powerful machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and encoding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queu@@ e of the encoder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is now maintained within &amp; nbsp ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , if you know with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre@@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , always read on ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio creator ; however , whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion .
strange , if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; nbsp ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound Proj@@ ector driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; each mi@@ di file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can be drag@@ ged to mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( such as song events or text events ) .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , K@@ Mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play option from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then played together . )
when &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to get back the original temp@@ o , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song , so that you do not need to manually adjust the entry . however , if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event type , choose from the Settings menu the entries Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nisse and Song Events . the same function has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are played back in series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider this when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when Autom@@ atically Add to Collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if an automatic add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . then this collection will then be added to the continued items .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu order sequence of the Men@@ us collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be set an@@ ew .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to ski@@ p a song , select Next song , next song next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song back , select the previous piece button , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection you want to delete and click Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI . in this case MIDI @-@ Map converts General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible GM ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An@@ other Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section it is stated how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the Gender Identi@@ fier is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and do not om@@ it a line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun , for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum @-@ Patch the patch is meant by which each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards own it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the key@@ maps , for example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , simply change the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
N is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyboard will be defined with the name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which relation P@@ itch @-@ B@@ ender occur@@ ren@@ ces are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch B@@ ender event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ b@@ aller event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave up . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , item MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob is no longer green but red in order to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to indicate the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : configur@@ ing
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support is compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
OK , that is why &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
check the Autom@@ atically link setting to the collection before . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; counter open &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file just enter the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to write on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga ( Spain ) . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really enjoy a great joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; before sending a MIDI file , you should get in touch with me since I might already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone else . I would like to emphasize that I will only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM radio device or an A@@ WE card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Last@@ ing Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you want to create an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not run . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can also be selected from the View menu and next Edit Mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu S@@ ame with Play@@ list and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author by &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; consider the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would interfere with the end animation , the user can therefore termin@@ ate the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; auto : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L supports by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file must be given by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages about loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; S@@ MB ; ( View , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end is taken for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been as@@ cer@@ tained ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player dialog is the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally by S@@ MB@@ s for the sources different names are used . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any evidence how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to be executed as root after the device is attached . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; sell .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems will probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be included .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile ; -@@ page .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support to this project or its documentation is desired , contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
if you have questions about or when you compile it , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; nbsp ; desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the ability to use all &amp; latex ; features in a graphic interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; works and its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can directly start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; items ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : lay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ y ( bottom lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
while here only a good Ã ¼ ber@@ sicht to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to control properly , good books , for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , may be consul@@ ted in 1999 .
just like other sign@@ age languages contains &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text tags are specified as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Ass@@ ist by &amp; k@@ ile ; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be done some settings related to the document .
document Cl@@ asses : this describes the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
coding : hereby the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for latex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN provisions ) . you should always find use in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; nbsp ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that any mathematical environment is not closed .
with the automatic execution of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line for creating the command ( e.g. \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings menu ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . Lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ CO@@ LD the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful for troubleshooting . as soon as a DVI @-@ file is created , jum@@ ps &amp; k@@ ry ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; Viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the formatt@@ ed document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the support search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; code is cli@@ cked on . as soon as click on a section in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code , the corresponding section will be locked in the DVI ; Viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about Project Properties .
quick structure : the latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be extended to inter @-@ tra@@ ine@@ es@@ â s ) and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast assembly .
when viewing the editing pane toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Select field is for items such as keywords , notes , or references . the available options are :
description : with this command a name for a section , an image or another element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is consul@@ ted for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the letters of letters . the letters of letters can be set for the main text , the notes of the notes , etc . the following letters are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the letters . if the letters are not set at the beginning , this can also occur later in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the latex can be compiled ; the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s construction or the Kn@@ op@@ fs Fast@@ Building .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically exclu@@ des storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched for errors in the log file . if you are using a quick build &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , you should start automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document . for example , a report with the letters of letters is created 12 , and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , then allows the change of the let@@ tering within the environment .
changes are only taken within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ stro@@ kes , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed in it@@ ali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
having the background to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now added to the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to this end , there should be a quotation , a few spots in fat and ital@@ ics and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or Ctrl E may return to the editor ( internal viewer ) . an external viewer has to close its window .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format ( E V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ dv@@ i output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into wanted other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the initial search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex ; bin@@ aries . for this , only Modern is to be set up under Settings ... Tools Build balanced .
to execute the default search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source text and cli@@ cked on the default search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; Viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
if there is no error when using Quick @-@ Building the &amp; DVI @-@ viewer , an error can exist . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log message file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source of error in the source text . in the editor , the La@@ Te@@ X errors and the most recent La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for spr@@ inting between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jum@@ ps to the faul@@ ty line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
high @-@ level users of latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings in General .
when creating the own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SI@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SI@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . as soon as the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any type of latex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , one should search for one on the internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; unique ; as internal editor . &amp; unique ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; unique ; and to learn its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can directly start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; items ; start .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called over the Men@@ Ã ¼ lap La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the &amp; tex word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ the \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par will be selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with the right mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key you can select parts of the source text in the editor window .
&amp; nbsp ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source @-@ texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants can incorporate additional jumping marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu editing spr@@ ing@@ marks or the corresponding key root causes the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this is also highlighted by this stamp , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; unique ; already excellent opportunities offers , have been added in &amp; nbsp ; key features for writing a &amp; latex ; source code adds many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; nbsp ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning then includes tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text ; the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the sentences are separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also contains latex ; -@@ commands with a back@@ s@@ lash ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; No ; offers the key Ctrl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Del@@ ete , the following commands are included for reading the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description for editing select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in latex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for additional commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment isn &apos;t destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sl@@ ated clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group will jump ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many bol@@ ted groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last open group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple sign @-@ signs are used as guests . for the purpose @-@ bringing realization , in &amp; nbsp ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple sign @-@ signs . also for the completion of the execution the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close leading signs for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic double quotation marks can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
foreign specific settings can also be used ( e.g. german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when Shift is pressed ; enter key &amp; k@@ ste ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. , enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; k@@ ry ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ ending line break down .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be set under Settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users would like to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try to make this possible . in case of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; seeks &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab in the following line . although this tab is not the addition , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some interval for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; works ; already a good source code completion offers , this has been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; to include special commands ( mostly for Lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ... more fully set .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , as a result , the complete list of characters can be gr@@ asp@@ ed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively , of &amp; k@@ ile , jum@@ ps can also be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jum@@ ps is possible and the desired parameters can then be consul@@ ted .
under Settings k@@ ile ; S@@ etting Up ... tile ; Compl@@ et@@ ely can make adjustments to these lists . there are different lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as local languages of the general language use are selected .
command mode is not useful for complete environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the complete failure mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the full @-@ space mode over the menu of a full @-@ spac@@ ed environment or the key root Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the surrounding conditions can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as you know it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command will be installed .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; Compl@@ et@@ ely can make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the Result List of the Total Commander Mode for &amp; tex ; - and Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; Supp@@ orts user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... K@@ ile can be fully furnished . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry is contained L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , when typ@@ ing the letter L and initi@@ ating the word full @-@ time mode over the menu of full @-@ time ab@@ duction or the key root Ctrl + Alt Space , the letter L will be replaced with the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large bott@@ oms are not helpful for automatic complete satisfaction . however , it has been found that many prot@@ esters are written more than once in a document . there@@ with , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete service for all already written products .
this mode can be set up in the menu item K@@ ile . K@@ ile can be fully shut@@ down . here , the threshold can also be set for the display of complete satisfaction .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the personal home folder . mode is available for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be followed and taken into account .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is solved , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed together in the menu creation comp@@ iling , creating conver@@ sions and creating views .

when using the Quick Start command a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open .

anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known my@@ pro@@ c and how excessive it is . if we add a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer relies on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the desired working folder , then leave the current working folder checked . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now there is a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file cho@@ oser required .

specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all of the plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a save location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze as button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be created for information on the team leaders when something is happening . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Side Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note notes is simple . either the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key word can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following options : team Manager Sub@@ project Director Fol@@ lowing the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the corresponding range or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and formatt@@ ing languages that is DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based form@@ ati@@ fication and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion , this can be modified .
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
auto closing : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
update start and finish tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : expression types for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
default D@@ DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is selected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in a separate view ( or documentation in a tab@@ by ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the default back next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / dependen@@ cy of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameters .
the warning message section provides the control of the possibility to switch off warning noti@@ fications by means of non @-@ stop requests .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree will automatically be opened . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
the area to specify short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from the third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load . only read @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the information entered is correct . selecting it allows saving the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ designed . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that displays the content of monitored variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started , the script will start with the request .
in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bit request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is requested .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include is broken down .
in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can adapt to your needs and how you and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can help you become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; its simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders include handy , symbolic links from picture buttons ( above the editing pane ) , the text and instructions quickly insert into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar buttons . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day displays . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just one element type .
the type of the tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
valid only for the type method . specifies the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a editing and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element only .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( i.e. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the Tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all tag XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; Notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a broken leg , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog will appear whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check only takes place when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ ename for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &lt; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for achiev@@ able DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list can be selected and D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action for the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned , with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . for example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% pi@@ d : is sub@@ stituted with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID # number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods enum@@ er@@ ated above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default input . in the selection box input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
in accordance with the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output , can be specified by setting the value to the default output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action knob at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , activate the Edit Tag dialog when available so that an input is possible while using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we encounter difficulties .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we &amp; ki@@ b@@ edit ; use . choose from &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graph More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ b@@ edit ; used default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually appear as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , send a message to the user that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool@@ bars to set dialog via Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( on the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by mastur@@ b@@ ating all symbols to make sure everything works .
after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please customize their file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the formatt@@ ing language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a PHP and PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to look for an existing documentation for the formatt@@ ing / script / etc . , then you must create the do@@ cr@@ c file . let &apos;s leave the first part to you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = func@@ 1 , func@@ 2 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the Docum@@ entation Tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file used to display context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not get rich about it but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
mit &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc@@ ard resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team takes them as accurate and useful for publication . in order to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which it is necessary for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can stay empty ) and start clicking OK the upload starts .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool@@ bars toolbar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message will appear with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the Menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . choose the .@@ dt@@ d file using the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tional line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three sections : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to back up different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ it the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card reader with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab@@ s , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as editing / past@@ ing / inser@@ ting , editing the tags in the mouse po@@ inter , help to the word under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , then click the symbol representing the tag . now you can enter the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and to ro@@ am . in the presentation with tab@@ s are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the breakdown in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ h the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the in@@ feed system , which is aligned to the content , enables the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . thus , for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the toolbar of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; nbsp ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , would be an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; nbsp ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing What someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . by the program Kom@@ mander , they can be extended , without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any script language syntax . ( read more about them in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ full help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there included special characters to the &amp; HTML ; depreciation , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as formatt@@ ing instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; depreciation , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script reports error messages !
search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
activ@@ ating and activ@@ ating the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecasts or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project toolbar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be saved using the Settings ... Tool@@ bars will be saved through tool@@ bars toolbar or you will be asked whether you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this will not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment .
allows you to upload tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
download an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags Edit menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent paste means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tool bar ref@@ uses when this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug@@ ins are listed among the menu items listed above . you activate them . click on an activated plug @-@ in to disable it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the original version .
choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate chan@@ ge@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the chan@@ ge@@ over can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card file mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the main window or off .
the changes in this dialog will influence every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
performs the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; works , one finds details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up from top to bottom , since e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name of the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adaptation might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu in the lower window or with Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Lower window profiles high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing a separate tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was open . currently , this behavior cannot be affected .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or icon Project from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files finds . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button :
here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be hidden to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password saved on the disk -@@ option is not available .
this will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted using the Project toolbar menu or the Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to boost productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best custom@@ iz@@ able using the Tools toolbar . using and Add tool@@ bars will be treated at the bottom of the Add tool@@ bars section .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the toolbar ) in which , with New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ amed or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action lab@@ eled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bar ... and setting actions settings .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files , etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents by links ( e.g. images with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the tree template .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment using a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file to a template folder only . it can be used for all file management functions such as drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping or inser@@ ting on the tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or associate with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop down sel@@ ector with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or featured templates for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back if necessary to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ scape of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , and PHP ; to edit , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; the cursor runs in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , pressing the active cursor from one window to another while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta .... By selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
if you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this is also possible to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this serves to reduce the manual coding .
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change to the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor is peculi@@ ar . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , for example , if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be tra@@ cked .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; buy ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; nbsp ; .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style sheet file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a previous age named my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches each QNA@@ P@@ ME template containing the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified my@@ QNA@@ P@@ name will be extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

start a shell . then enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
inserts the parameters with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ s ; and the value &amp; lt ; VA@@ LU@@ E@@ id ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the add@@ par@@ am command
if the conversion exec@@ utes 20 times when --@@ repeat is double @-@ specified , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for it has been enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml
activ@@ ates the X@@ include processing of the input document if the support for it has been enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default .
with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed on systems , you can scroll down the cursor keys of the previously executed commands using the arrow keys .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully @-@ qualified name as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ Win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
path : a path to changing the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML document processed by the style sheet . see &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ ANS ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;
running time commands : { b@@ ye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit } , step , Step@@ Up , Step@@ Down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the in@@ dent at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where only the in@@ d@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows resol@@ ving conflicts and at the same time display the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; # diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger if somebody changes the in@@ d@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog re@@ members your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
using the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file .
the S@@ etting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing and mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it above a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dro@@ pping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the locations where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line will be sc@@ ored dotted lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription output : , the file name and &#91; structure &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the Jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also create a jump of the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each to the left a black bar appears .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no more line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the queu@@ e ; indicated . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe again select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , or in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; mer@@ ging conflicts ; however appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters as well .
navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page from , beginning , end , Ctrl @-@ Start and Ctrl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Mer@@ ge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Ctrl @-@ bottom / Ctrl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ figure For@@ ward / Ctrl @-@ figure For@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you select , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line end@@ ings are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ forward character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end@@ ings of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when finished and restored next time . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adjust@@ s an un@@ even color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copying in the clip@@ board will be om@@ itted .
you can select which line end type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
comparing files attempts &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again save only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignor@@ es &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; the chari@@ ot return character is made visible , however , as a white character is treated . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . in default , this will be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow on very large files .
in automatic jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Cho@@ ose A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflict from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the Automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see documentation on the directory comparison and merge for details .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is checked , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a short notice appears what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit un@@ ic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or summary columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ign@@ ore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply drop the less important windows . ( this option is in the Window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide not to merge the files . the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file file used will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a regular pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . the output of the command is only used for line breaks . you can write your own pre @-@ processor exactly matching your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command line for line alignment to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a fre@@ eze expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ 1 converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword created text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line offset is needed . you can change the list as needed . you can change the list as needed . the \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another command line for line separ@@ ations . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / En@@ forcement / Switch &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the subsequent operations will only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for mer@@ ging for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... simul@@ ates the mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you need to specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , folder 3 is used as a destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 displays ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to open all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or open all the folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears .
the name in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green then becomes yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the syn@@ cing mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New@@ er file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is checked , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files , but the same date appears error : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such bugs are not fixed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging one file is processed after the other . you status column shows skill when mer@@ ging was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK .
if in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then C is used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der mer@@ ging mode , B is chosen as a target while syn@@ cing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might ski@@ p certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid merge actions still exist by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message will appear indicating the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will pop up with options Con@@ duct , Simul@@ ate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select to start / continue directory mer@@ ging again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then you execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if you encounter a bug , a message appears and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge together ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with mer@@ ging .
if some entries were merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not merge again . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ indicate file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a pre@@ defined dot sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in an endless loop and &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
the files are considered as identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful e.g. if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that both folders are identical . the results of mer@@ ging files will be saved in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it assumes the knowledge that the other file is not modified . ) This option is disabled by default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and preser@@ ves the extension .@@ original If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ orig enlargement , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally the folder merge view will be visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the directory &amp; text window into the main window in the Window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly from the mer@@ ging menu . as soon as you save the result , the status is set to replace and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge .
this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : list -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit cre@@ denti@@ als or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first with the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it he@@ ats ac@@ compli@@ ces ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection .
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines will be next to each other , this par@@ is par@@ is par@@ is often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too great so far . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly ; No src is swe@@ pt ; released and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; # diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thanks !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .

cut out ( Ctrl @-@ X or Shift ) copy to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( Ctrl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position resp@@ . replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after making changes to these options . )
this will also mean that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain those files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled by default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button .
this option is disabled by default . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , quit them or move them . this works in both a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both a desktop as well as on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button clicks is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and Finish . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is selected together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is selected , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems only .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2 x grid , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move windows as icons or with its contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then setting up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :

you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read the paper a magni@@ fying glass for the print @-@ print or the accurate viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; .
&amp; lt ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below .
in default setting it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may or may want to show a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse po@@ inter to be displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window will stand firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; none ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update brings the required CPU time to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , no@@ vice ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can magni@@ fier ; use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual disabled .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse po@@ inter res@@ ides in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ imp@@ anz@@ ine @-@ in@@ jury syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the cursor freezes for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate drag@@ ging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain associated with the use of your computer may also help you scan a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion short .
the intelligent shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before letting the mouse button run . in this way , you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
when Intel@@ lig@@ ently moves on , the Rot@@ ary Move Time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wa@@ its before the mouse button starts again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse cursor . if this function is enabled , a slow moving moves to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; then go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times .
if this setting is selected , and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only under &amp; nbsp ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the user is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease with sounds .
first , you should be aware of which positions a mouse click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . therefore , you can use the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when a move has just started . if you use the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by letting the mouse button finish .
this happens when you and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way each time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button clicks a sound like a mouse click away . so you know exactly when when smart moving starts moving time . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble click of a mouse .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case on most of the system .
the function of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter res@@ ides . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those suffering from the bri@@ st@@ est pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . thus drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can be done .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that should be discussed again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command later used for the speech output of text . see the Setup dialog for more details .
on the second page you can choose the standard text@@ book . from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the word for the word @-@ per@@ mitting . &amp; mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can copy the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in the words of the word .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a disk space of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have a mouth , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the disk space . you can select sets that should be re @-@ spoken .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; this dialog includes two card cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ase and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the voice output voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed to the voice generator as the default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you can find this command in the documentation of your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use t@@ ts@@ d as a language service , mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . the t@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Dem@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the box for text pass@@ books .
with the selection of In stock , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection of Add to the input field , the selected text passage will be entered only into the input field .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector for the text pass@@ book allows you to specify whether the text pass@@ code book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text pass@@ code book , the book is saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text@@ book is not saved . choose before saving to ask , will &amp; mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ase page contains a list of wor@@ kt@@ ops for the word completion . in the main window beside the input field , you can see and mouth ; a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main section of the window for editing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
adding actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting in the menu bar , toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the idle memory .
when this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar by clicking on the left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window is displayed with hints about the status of &amp; mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bars above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for the speech output on the map file voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eh@@ . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :

the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various speech output systems .
since adjusting the voice generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use t@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in &amp; mouth in the settings dialog ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can output text by the machine . it is a list of already spoken sentences that the user can always rep@@ ay again and again .
note that &amp; mouth does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL into &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar ; or run the help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules that allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . users also offer interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; unique ; , also if &amp; unique ; embedded in other &amp; nbsp ; applications .
speech output takes place via speech speech program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the bug h@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) take place discussions about &amp; kt@@ on ; in the k@@ de @-@ opens mailing list . subscribe to the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and configure speech speech speakers . see also
on the first start of t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the map file is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map file is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different mas@@ cul@@ ine or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should set up a speaker before you start &amp; kt@@ on ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are similar to several printer spool lengths for the same printer .
when you click on the map index leader in t@@ sm@@ gr , the map file speaker will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker will be used for the speech output if an application does not specify a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also specifies its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Card@@ board Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; already almost . go back to the map file in general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map file to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language sharing system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map folder in General to open the map file . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable &amp; kt@@ on ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map file is displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar when reading it , it dis@@ appears once the reading has been completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start , pause , pause , and record text jobs .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; nbsp ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card file is only displayed when the K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text you want to read and select Tools Text from the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; works , the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . first check the text you want to read and select Tools Text from the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this works also when &amp; items ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
the Noti@@ fy is the message system from &amp; k@@ de ; it noti@@ fies you about events you set . you can also read the text of this message by &amp; t@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ on , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program notification , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for the Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of supply of &amp; t@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes tags br and b from messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed as provided in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ on ; for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to substitute false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ on ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these jobs . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after issu@@ ing the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you receive from the map file is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text entries are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ on ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters .
character string plac@@ er replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery &amp; t@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are available for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the map file speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text job , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further down @-@ down dial@@ ogues will be displayed .
for the creation of string selection filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these samples are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker is speaking one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; Ctrl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must om@@ it you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the dial@@ ogs Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions . &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; prints can be found in the package of deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forms . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the microphone selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; t@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program pre@@ fers the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; the speaker will be selected and the features of the speakers configured on the card file are selected .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs , you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the Spe@@ aker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; enables program@@ mers to give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; reform@@ ulation filter , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make SA@@ BLE at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found over the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain notes or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ on ; have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ cryp@@ t &amp; kt@@ ts package ; you can find it in the t@@ d folder . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ stra@@ p.@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . also check the website of t@@ ts ; for information that is not yet included in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand it , you can connect to the developer team for the use of another syn@@ thesizer .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile , compile , you need a recent development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech software program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bug , or downloaded the recently created t@@ arb@@ all , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; kt@@ on ; check first whether speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher is working properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the speech . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program is to be developed in such a way that speech memory is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences , allowing the user to return punc@@ ture or paragraph mode , pause , pause or cancel the output .
if an application contains text on &amp; t@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is female English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ on ; a speaker cho@@ oses , see in .
when you click Add Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man on Add , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map file speaker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the string for text passed to the festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; t@@ ts , this setting is automatically done . in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , Eastern languages such as Czech and Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the chosen voice does not allow you to select these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be displayed when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text , so you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card file speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , before or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over and t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio Card . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . read more about the News Typ@@ es of &amp; kt@@ on ; find in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; t@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries .
if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the Spe@@ ech speed here . up to 50 % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ ml ; % roughly corresponds to the double normal speech speed . in order to be able to implement these settings , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ad system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this card @-@ card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text job is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language assignments :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader has been read , the reserved orders will be res@@ um@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you have &amp; eg ; just let a long text read on a website , you can with &amp; mouth ; still welcome someone who enters the room .
if a text job is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e .
this audio file is then played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and screen readers &apos; issues , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; t@@ ts ; noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the board map noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to turn on &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications turn on . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; do not read not@@ ices .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ on .
use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ on .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ on ; do when an event arrives . you have the following options :
if you have selected Custom Text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the Card@@ board Spe@@ aker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do this , you can set the pre @-@ notification settings as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button Load to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for control of voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . in addition , brands for control of pron@@ unciation , for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; t@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation filter ( S@@ DB @-@ Fil@@ ters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . thus you can start reading faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set has to syn@@ thes@@ ize , or stop or stop jobs , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you can see the punc@@ tu@@ ation filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ on , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add other set limit recognition filters , but beginners will be advised of it .
in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch jobs , which speaker &amp; kt@@ on , on the card board , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster to start reading , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can last very long ,
you can stop or ab@@ ort orders on the map file , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement code recognition filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
the punc@@ tu@@ ator recognition filter matches text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are removed automatically from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal movement recognition filter from Ver@@ see , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the Spe@@ aker menu card selection , you can over@@ ride the microphone settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card reader ) . in other words , there are no speaker properties specified .
if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ on ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ on ; the speaker that most likely matches the originally set properties .
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as the primary attribute . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one placed in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the Standard Spe@@ aker select button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text job in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but t@@ sm@@ gr does not show that voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ es@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices , add the new voice . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be trace@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker equipment . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the speed settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ views . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) disable either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hap@@ ing filter , and set up the Spe@@ ech speed .

before you start , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ on .
you need to install at least one language . help find the instructions included with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / x / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the Linux &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the M@@ MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this de@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text slides .
with this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; files , but in the folder festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playing the bug fixes is not required , you only need to re @-@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with the I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work .
un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the lex@@ icon . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , source @-@ approved voice syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor microphone speed can be set .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ on ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; this allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ conf package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ conf file ; creating a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in the installation of &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Index . when starting the module network settings , this will try to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and the release level . by selecting Not @-@ again questions the setting can be permanently hit . the next start of the network settings then automatically pres@@ et this selection .
changing network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning that the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the bottom right of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider Network interfaces :
the settings of indicated network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to be set up in the Settings dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options .
with the option Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection Manual without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole , you can find out if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switch on an out@@ dated network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching off an activated network device will be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host asks htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS replaces this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the holder &apos;s name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons on or down in priority .
by clicking on the Add ... button from the group to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
select an entry from the group Calcul@@ ator for the name resolution and then click the Edit button .... It is displayed in the Edit dialog .
the name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when there are no DNS servers available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of name @-@ known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os , and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit .... The Create computer dialog will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole using rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ c.@@ The following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technique is given , in the second one will discuss all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; variable configuration files .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently , IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found widespread use . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently concentr@@ ating on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that assign@@ s a valid IP address or , if available , can be used by DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a designated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , most of the addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that have been affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .

before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; nbsp ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; re@@ trains the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre @-@ tension@@ ing force on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be formatt@@ ed .
recognize &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , search for the right index on your disk . can &apos;t it be found , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; passes through a change of the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; nbsp ; it must be formatt@@ ed by &amp; dat .
a band type must be formatt@@ ed before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape must be formatt@@ ed before use , this must happen before you are formatt@@ ed by &amp; nbsp ; Flo@@ ppy tape drives generally do not require formatt@@ ing of the tape , DAT drives are not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the formatt@@ ing process , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been opened , the dialog box opens . in this dialog , you can check again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the audit process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that should be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be installed separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
the Settings menu can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command will mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read@@ - or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try to lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . this setting may not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it will automatically be ej@@ ected when the &amp; dat connection is released ; the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ specific block size for the tape drive is changed . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; dat ; in any case , share the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is formatt@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( N Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatt@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape has been formatt@@ ed .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file directory .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which are directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; nbsp ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . furthermore , and k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , it enables &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and analyzed .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among others include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start attempts &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you do not display it , and it will open instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not started with system administrator privileges . under Linux , log files usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string . the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed , so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then compared only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you will see and k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of the step error are displayed with a more consp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol line of the step Note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the Filter Panel .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new line in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocols .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in the menu to view it .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful yet more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ att@@ ing . &amp; Linux ; kernel looks at first on / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. There you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you will need a script for every system service you want to run at startup of the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something remotely with the serial port .
the kernel looks for the program at different points and starts the first one to find .
the default run level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you do something on the in@@ itt@@ ab . if you do something , then you will be able to repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how do all the right scripts start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would pers@@ ist the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc ; .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ ine or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will not happen only if they extract an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new area . simply select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target zone -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the item number of an entry cannot sometimes be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below previous .
to move an entry to a different run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ TR@@ L ; X ) and paste it into the desired run level with Pa@@ ste ( with Ctrl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ oi@@ vel@@ ines , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files do not exist or are in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; .
after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two board cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user / group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card file will be created , where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management board map appears if shadow passwords are installed , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card file only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation
the card file groups are informed about the group members of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you can find in the field Prim@@ mo@@ PA . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more .
