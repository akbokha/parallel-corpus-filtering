<seg id="1">The module's website can be compiled in & Konqueror; the menu can be translated into Tools website. select the source and destination language of the translation from the list to be retracted.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation previously.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translatable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains several modules for & Konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & Konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & Konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map file tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings from the kde package; addons. please note that some more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & icon; see Extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in & Konqueror; menu bar under Extras pane filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory with different types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; is to graphically display nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-Maps permit the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected, even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap diagram a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only when sufficient space is present or if the area of child rectangular rectangles can be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps display algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. frames are drawn to display the nesting of the entries, and that frames require space that is then no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How partition the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recurrent branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View Add to Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subset entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image Gallery module can be found in & Konqueror; View picture gallery... or with CTRL; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Image Gallery module, a dialog box opens, which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails of every line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To view the file name of the image, select whether the filenames are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, select whether the file size is shown in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">To view the image size check box, select to see if the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which sub-folders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In File Selection in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set up a slide bar or a rotating field to which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the gallery where you want to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the box comment file, you can specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Custom color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & Konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in & Konqueror; menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The Media Return for the navigation pane can be found in & Konqueror; View menu in the Navigation Pane window or use the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear into the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing Browser Recognition add a menu entry in & Konqueror; in addition, with which you can change the browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with specific browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Standard Browser Recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that deny access to this browser, change the browser identification to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password to MSIE for pages that refuse access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browsers recognition to access & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not conform to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser ID is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digi. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicame; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicame; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicame; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all, programs is also & digipments; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digiplug; attempts to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all necessary information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicame; is a project supported by a community. that is, users and developers are helping each other. if you are a regular user of & digicame; then we would like you to answer questions to other users of & digicame; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicame; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicame.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digicame; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digiplug; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data base is saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicame; you will additionally use as Albenbibliothek. settings digitiam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digicame; views every subfolder as an album. no picture will be altered.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; Enjoys recursively the library path across its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albentag don't have any photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digiplug; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help menu help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digi. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicame; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the camera then appears as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicame; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, extension software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicame; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see preview images or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digicame; is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugin Interface Project (Handbook) is a common module structure for & digibatches; to develop KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digistepped; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and removing images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaums, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields indicated in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this ind is displayed as the symbol view. which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of the Albian settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digicame are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose this album Import Photos. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the destination album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move it to the destination album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set is used to sort your photos when you select from the toolbar or view albums Go to the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons oldest, average, nests: these set the date on the one of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the album. to do so, the average of the pictures from their EXIF information is first tried. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digicame; open, the first image is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As album preview & quot;. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicame; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keywordlist at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying glass buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you must wait for a short while while the preview images are generated. this allows you to avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. which information is available, you can change settings digicame; set up the albums page and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can access all the functions that came with & digi. you can select all the functions associated with & digi. you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit.... image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicame; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. the applications listed there are managed by the & kde; file assignments for the file type.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digiplug; Delete, it will be moved to the trash bin by & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or Del If you prefer to delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My dates list quot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digicame; uses either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When one keyword is selected, all photos associated with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lipopup, so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My stitch quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can be only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use key words, you must first mark your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to add with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My stitch quot; drag and drop there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumbnails of the pictures and select cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear below the thumbnail of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved via this histogram. to select a time frame, you just need to click on the bottom rectangle of the box to indicate the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection, which will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next he search box is a small lamp that gets green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if The search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you get a simple search box like the one described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criterion. after you have been saved it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window. the text box Save Search as will be used to select a name in My search list. if you want to change your selection once again, you will need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form will return to the search information entered previously. if you select Add as Advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. for more information, see The Advanced Search Tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete search from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digipr's database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. all rules are added by line by operators, enumerated. one option can be added to this list with search group / delete group. each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... At least, you can create Search of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicame; each picture characterizes by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one. by means of a disk, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: open-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicame; find the right images. also here a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive tool search tool based on the Marble miniature program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicame; provides a lighting console in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add Following Table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window will be opened. if you are back in & digipr, you can quickly open the lighting table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview synchronization from the toolbar and execute zoo and move operations on one of the pictures, then they will be executed in the other image as well. you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate from the toolbar, then the first two pictures are automatically loaded into the field for comparing. now use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane. this simplifies the work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions work directly from the lighting table, such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the lighting table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click on it and hold down the & LMB; in the mode Preview, then both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works as well as in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both images if you are the same in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management examines each part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. we focus on the procedures for digital fotographers the & digicame; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, categorize, backup, optimize, wait and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management records, indexes, categorized, secures, searches, transformes, assembles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is according to your definition data, which provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find a certain photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use sure not & digicame;. the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. the remaining photos will organize on the basis of your date. if you do enough photos then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digi. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can later save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Album from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which one? added & digicame; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicame; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are processed by & digicame; updated as it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different meta-data intersect. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">From the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer to it then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Major quot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription on its own.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labelling. KDE can even set it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE can even export your images to web galleries. so, you will have to tell the story for the publication no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical data. you can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. however, you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a copyright and designates the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples for this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the vendor drop to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency will provide the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they have no protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify this, in the picture, digital watermarks. for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digicame; in the near future there will be a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, plate failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, cadaemia, lifetime, temperature, data size, dispersed superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very prone to mistakes, even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they filter by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; it is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of corrupted disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data back to check it. also, you should copy the media with a description, date & author mark and then transfer to a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disclaimers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives on this subject: DiskInfo</seg>
<seg id="187">In a nutshell: discs do the longest if they are operated at temperatures from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is SMART. some of the errors stated by SMART herald the imminent failure. these are particularly read errors and relocation counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electricity, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy jokes and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. remember, however, that not every connector strip also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, please ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shooter, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for laptops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the option to store your data and to shut down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of current disruptions with the costs to avoid this. high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than €40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. moreover, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are referenced on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. data transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed storage in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs is at least secure the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebooks and 46% on workstation systems. with notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than e.g. thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a loss of data every year. so back up your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prophylaxis always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbouring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Safeguarding: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differentiator.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time when such a backup is made. this backup comes to a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase the security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come up for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC information stored in the image file, retained XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and rate new over time. unfortunately, there is no other way to keep a certain vigilance. however, every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with the plan and you want to enlarge the area you want to grow on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBit; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for an improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relatively many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licence-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliges to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already makes DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why since 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a blend of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the meta file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert the raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images again; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only then export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicame; in the Adding a Photos to an album you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer Note, GPS etc. this information is the same as for the metadata side bar from the main window of & digistepped; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All. this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digicame;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the Selected download button is checked until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not yet been downloaded by & digicame; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the All or download selected folders, a dialog will show you to select the destination album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be displayed, as normal folders are sorted. you can read the list of existing albums in the My albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicame; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you must select them first and then delete selected delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully put into a & digip; album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera completely, you should do this about the camera view, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames if you upload photos of different recording-series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard AutoriIdentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format as the default format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option Date and Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in capital letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digicame; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, you do not let & digicame; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, you can automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & digicame; the photos directly in the destination album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is finished, & digicame; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicame; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailer and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. right with the right hardware, about reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and finally over the manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract and correlate the data of images and of the GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Exiftool of Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of havred coordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicame; try to give you so much control over his work sequences as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digicame; change. to access these settings, you need to select the settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing should be set. thus, you set the default behavior of & digistepped; fixed when you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. this data is also written in the IPTC fields during a database synchronization.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author-line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to provide the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this allows the metadata to be permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digicame; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digi. imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image captions as embedded scriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images store: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the pictures. this allows you to read your lettering from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digicame; to indicate, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in one & digicame; album folder that has none of these extensions, by & digistepped; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lighting console & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the lighting console these settings are switched on if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; can only be used on fast machines. if you have one then you can obtain better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image editing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma Subsampling refers to the fact that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data needs more time for getting out and packing. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn on the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality as the DEFLATE algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">If you select the lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicame, image editing was only one image viewer for photos. at the moment, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are the same. if the scrolling green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top light, so the parts of your pictures that are burned, as a result of the inability of your camera to look at the top lights as a continuous white. use the setting through white in the settings. the setting colors release some unusual results as it indicates the top light in various rosatos. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & lumbar; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digistepped; image processing can be made. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demos icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub-raw data generated by the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like that. as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenous-Directed) was used for me and the paper used by myself. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softer correction since it is performed during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digicame; information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other so that colors are as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Place the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digicame; examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profiles You have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera man and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate, as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors hence very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & nbsp; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & nbsp; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface & digicame; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and then they will be loaded by & digicame; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn off the metadata that is displayed at the bottom of the images during ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left. on the right-hand side there is a button Auto detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, powered on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / parameters to mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digicame; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu Cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the trash bin, you can adjust the conversation of & digistepped; setting a photo in an album. in the deletion of a photo and deleting an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes caused by the right sidebar can be tacitly performed by & digistepped; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button Change.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display and digipate the display of the welcome screen; this speeds up the start process of & digicame under certain circumstances;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup Beim Start to search for new photos forces & digicame; searching the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digicame;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digicame, you asked if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be made in & digi. use to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicame, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicame; includes quick image editing with some base tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digi. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting Up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing will change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save file or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu from the File menu or using the Restore button on the Edit button. you will then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can undo you by modifying or restoring editing by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should revert the shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo Ctrl; Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the back-back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl, mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar can be displayed. if you do not want this, you can do this in the settings dialog of & digistepped; you can view it from & digicame; see the section for setting up the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select from the File Image menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or complete sets. entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Print Assistant from the Album Export. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicame; main window has a sidebar on the right, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tab is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size. note the text below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database, but you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Assessment section displays an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the key shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field gency. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with previously used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. thus, you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords for a series of pictures. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword ID.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filtering is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. then the options look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digicame; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you insert a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable departure from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours that you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, then everyone would like to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor, since sRGB requires that your; onitor is callibrated. if you work as a sRGB color space, you need either to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalization, Same, Automatic Same and Contrast Enhanced from the Correcate Automatic correction program automatically attempt to make the best from your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the luminous intensity of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity scale is as flat as possible. it sometimes results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Broaden contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a reconfiguration of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will fail.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left you will see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original whitepaper, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow tuning lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colours if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter Colour Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under Color Correction Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same correction and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; Tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar stabilisation, also called sabatical, was an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and afterwards inverted the development of the image. the coloured, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an upturned reversed color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias heavily saturated colors are too much for those who barely see landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photo. you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting entries you can look at in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all the changes you perform can be previewed. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool change correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the scope explained here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be previewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most commonly used. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma readings.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values. for example, the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later. for that purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means, and sunshades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjusting input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified Channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darken the corresponding image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original image you will see a red mark. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, mid- and sunshades. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunshades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer & digiplug; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color shade of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colors Channel Mixer of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to preserve Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are also using the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colour space consists of small space artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion by reducing the color shower first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any mixer setting can be saved and loaded for later. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Option Luminance is activated. the original picture can be seen at (1) and the processed picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your possibility of abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PANF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 crunin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of the bleaching of a pressure and the re-development in a sepia. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepia filter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper of texture has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digiplug; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the image transforms with a colored line, niepce transforms it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), backspilled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool To cut the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been stored, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digiplug; apply the template template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation. you must however take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digicame; simply send an email in English to the & digicame; Mailing list digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil file using the Folder button in dialog. select the folder where you copied the templates. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After setting the root folder for templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder will be displayed. the selection of a folder updates the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the entire image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works more psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process paints colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges to become a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more consecration than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the Sharpening Factory Default. you can use the menu item Correcy to call Shares.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should handle this carefully, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. generally, the most useful technique to sharpen an image refocus the tool. you can refocus it via the menu entry Corrigation. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image slightly softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to softmark with the menu item Correcate softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unblurable masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount sets the percentage between the original and the blurred image to be added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filters. in this way areas with a soft alternation between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocus refocusing an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. you can start it from the menu by starting colors refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the gauss' folding. the gauss' folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also on the source pixeles that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, FIR's inverse of the Gauß 'fold is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will pollute the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your unclear gauge is' sch. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the die size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for that parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much of the operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave nasty artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking using a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically speaking, unsharp masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness regulates the blur of the area that was darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unparalleled artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default options as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default options are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use tab Glue and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions, and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that sharpening should always be subordinated to direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD hiss, a high value produces wavy similar patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise exists, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. be sure that small angles create a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0.1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">It can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture errors with minor artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact created during the journey. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. of dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial in English.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy smoker that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindows details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can stay with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter looking forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is increased, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubricating occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light Density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that controls the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that controls the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly roughed up.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. luckily, the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to mark softness with the menu item Correcate softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film granting, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with reduced noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granting on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were used to reduce to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner light and the photo paper. the original picture can be seen below (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicame; Tool Hotpixel allows you to remove pixels from photos that were with a CCD camera gem, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode, since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-photo extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dunkelbild. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you take the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and automatically loads it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you correct the result inside the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel pegs. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original picture has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicame; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large picture format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the iris filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should, even with center filters, use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color or greyscale implementations of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignette correction filter and three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous intensity and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicame; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grade corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion of second degree. with negative values tonnenoid distortion can be corrected and positive values cissenuniform distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lentils the 'corners' parameter has the reverse mark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and causes a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image resizes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The toned or cissing correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. the best way to perform this correction is the first one. if you re-cut an image and then perform a tint correction, the effect would appear to be the wrong effect.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cissing distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transformers Cut box from the image editing or via the Zoom Controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenoid correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infra-red film of the Gimpguru.org website that can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granting and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granularity if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film granting and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter blends colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a sort of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filtration filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granting on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granting effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the applied film sensitivity conforms to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; oil painting filter creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicame; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side viewed, the hingness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the machined part is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicame; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. images whose gradients slowly change are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; Filter engraving defines your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filters engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, daring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Waveforms 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Waveforms 2: analog to the wavelengths 1 the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to compute and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurred the image by horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or a train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelly sharpening: blurs the image by a random displacement of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to compute and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using the & digiplug; image editing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it into the right orientation by mirroring or rotating. the tools for this can be found in the Transformers Rotate or Transformers menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm which is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change. choose this transformation size change in menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with better quality, then try to blow up the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many imaging programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise exists, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly. each stabling for photo can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast on what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to trim a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut away. this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the editing button of the editing pane in the toolbar and the photo will be trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the Preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool To cut aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool To cut the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the range for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are saved in the EXIF-tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly assistance make it possible to help you to make your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-level rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division divided into various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden centre.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied help lines when putting together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve. compared to the third gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can just be there without directing the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to do this transform Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees again. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point in the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transformers Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed for a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to trim the picture with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, a horizontal shift will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shears your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shatter horizontally and vertically. if you press on default settings, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line will be displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two shuttering creates twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is to cut the picture with Transformers Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digi..</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency from other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all the file formats available on your system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicame; shows only files in formats that you know. this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digicame; the file in the image processing is displayed. you can change this list of file extensions the & digipv; accepts. in the configuration section you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digicame; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter & digicame; in the configuration section you will find further information on the use of modules with & digicame;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools like Shares, Characteristics, Noise Reduction, refocus, Unsharp masked, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below, you can see & quot; texture applying quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame for selecting the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive tool search tool based on the Marble miniature program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kdiagram Viewer project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kdiagram Viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kdiagram viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & unique; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph is in & unique; the graphene is recalculated and in & kgraphics; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & works; to open or to open the graphs in & kgraphics; in one & unique; -component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kGUI viewer; is a & kde; program which requires & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for displaying graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. in the beginning, if you start & kdiagram; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list Last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgraphics; uploaded file has been modified from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your choice later, you can use the Settings kscreen viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & kscreen viewer, and eg; in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kappviewer; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it to the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">Upon program start, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several pages, you can choose to fit the parts of the graph, which come to a page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphs distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut shop page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphics; when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that every time a graph is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphics. you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or specify to be requested at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu normally appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBs; opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz and layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for unfinished graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springle model layout for unfinished graphs. it uses the Fruchterman pure gold heuristic, and includes a multiple grid trigger for treating large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm ranks the nodes in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directional or unfinished) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for unfinished graphs).</seg>

Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera's online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you are using the module for the first time, you will be run through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is launched to enable you to login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module has started exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current access authorisations that the module displays. at present, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add Photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, you can upload photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above dialog appears. in order to perform a possible correlation about time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the time zone must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is included, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the difference in time of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlation to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the respective region and enlarge sie.Include this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the Exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the selection allows you to select all the albums to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below, the Albenvorschau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer, & eg; Skill show</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Rider for preview images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module generates the pages, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can read the program messages to see if errors during the generation have occurred. the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as turning, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After startup, an image is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loss-free module is a tool to modify images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below listed actions, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size is rising, since no compression of the colour information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently does not have documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you can select the destination image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after clicking the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for your slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diasau. then you can start the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the picture transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoding or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this IPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original tremble from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it creates the same results as the software from your camera vendor. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the option to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all the images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-processing: prepares the image for photographic print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size, and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails sent. it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG File Format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original excitation data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. you can close this window with the Close button.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions like your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects that you can choose between. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Module Background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have finished your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, there are now entries in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press people with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person you will only see the images on which both of them are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum, but for each person a separate preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view pictures next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must however choose which picture to display for each individual person. in order to do this, you need to open the image view window (in closer detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the entire date. you can also use a section of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum, and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; launch demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum, see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name implies, this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline lets you use the following ways interactively: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time values. if you select a range, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is integrated in & photovoltaic (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the duplicate and a description that the HTML file should contain later on. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages, see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether you want to create a photovoltaic / photo album; an export file is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages, so you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that all images are exported from a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser is started after the pages have been created. the URL you specify here should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings below have all three related to base folders or URLs. a sub-folder will be created in this folder whose name will be set to the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create your pictures with these pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time collecting the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; do not do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can share all the images and pass that file as independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can call through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With option Manually copy to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want this anyway, just select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can say that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu..., will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing wizard consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder you want to copy the import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category persons to the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is called persons. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, over (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically reuse it in future Starts. if you want to read another folder in & kphotoalbum, then start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the Settings kphotoalbum menu item, you can access a window by which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will find the various settings options explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can view by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up full members groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & nbsp; but are distributed separately. however, most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules are tested with & nbsp; only very little. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures. Demo database can be used either via command line with command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between photo album and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications put their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that the picture preview currently shows you.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, a list of albums must be handed over to the modules. here is a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category persons, you will be doing a photo album, so do so if you selected persons to view them and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a new photo album with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and a toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse through your image database. in the section, we will return to this window, but now click on the images to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to annotate any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons you see in the picture, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures is illustrated by Jesper and all images were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, since you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are mapped, you can find that the names used are moved up, locate the persons more quickly and classify them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting after date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S.. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. in order to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. see this step in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all images if you don't set a filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; even use pictures without having you saved on the hard drive. of course, you must have saved the pictures somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can get in the database index; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not saved on the hard drive. for example, the thumbnails are present for the pictures 1-9. however, for the images 5-9, the preview images are present so that you can preview these pictures. however, you can't view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy and re-copy files from the folders. & nbsp; do not yet support you to insert the relevant CD. so if you want to avoid annoying about how to avoid confusion of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible and click on Current View in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also navigate all the images that your little sister is allowed to see and lock the menu item All but up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set what images should be hidden in case of case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as an unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to help those who are with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to manage all your pictures with a photo album; manage and spend hours about hours so you want to describe it is natural that you want to look at them at some point. for this reason has a photo album; over a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and place somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available right-clicking on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and forth by using the keys image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a slide. & nbsp; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. start and stopped the slideshow by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer's & kphotoalbum; it is easy to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the full screen on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can zoom in and out. to zoom in, you can easily zoom in with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the MOOption the zooms sets so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that start and zoom in with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the picture. at the moment you can break the preview and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to mark only the picture and view other pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer will give you the opportunity to see images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view, see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">If you have any features placed on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you want to edit, print, or whatever you have selected, just add all the images you have selected. then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view categories in the display view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed to color photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the painting from the context menu. to close the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire modal views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all subjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Paste menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene using deletion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User Documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL-user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subcategory element. if you only want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. Objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as required. you can also store multiple window configurations and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on one another, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the cards pointing up in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window layout is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring, drag the starter to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the drop down bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the bar. to prevent the closure, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window layout. it will display a dialog where you can store the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the rendering icon rendering the rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item view scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View of render modes... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but makes sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small part of the picture, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality of combination, you can select the properties which & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè sample or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is again and again divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels, which can be followed individually and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is creating noise for the beam process called jittering. if you turn on jittering changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the Import File menu... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; renders a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your retention and the version. support versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example, height field data) in paths to & Povray; -Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to those files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values produce a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high level of detail for advanced projections, all wire-model views are further divided, if the camera uses an expanded projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives better approximation for the projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing windows orders or create new window classifications. in the window classifications section explains how to create and store windows orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window system: displays all existing windows orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window layout when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window classifications shows all existing windows orders. a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you will anchor the window under the existing window, with map map you get a card map view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert any light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and then select the Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireframe view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the scene view from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or press the Enter key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (paste infinite body quad) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the Object Tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited finite level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can unfold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please choose first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter the pigment settings. therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header and ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then open the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Single. select this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the Object Tree, select each time colour and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to apply the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor, since you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the sphere a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Solid Color and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings for gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog impact. thus, the scene is processed pixel by pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered is needs some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest item in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. this menu entry can only be selected when you have finished editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, shortcut keys and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new commands preset with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to pretend rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Base bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuilshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for displaying.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & Cuddshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1161">In the field of exposure indicators, you can select the color displayed when the subexposed or overexposure indicator is selected. dexterity should be in contrast with what you should display. underexposure should display a light color and exposure to a dark color.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The main window of & showfoto; has a sidebar on the right, providing you with important information and actions to the selected images. you can also find the same page bar in the image editing. you can view them where you click on one of the five tabs:</seg>
<seg id="1163">& skanlite; is an application for scanning images that do not make any more scan and save images.</seg>
<seg id="1164">& skanlite; is a simple application to scan images that no longer do than scan and save images. & skanlite; can open a dialog for saving, or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format. the user can also display the pictures before saving them.</seg>
<seg id="1165">You can check the status of your scanner's support on the SANE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.</seg>
<seg id="1166">A standard scanner can be set on the command line of & skanlite; with the command skanlite -d [device name] in the terminal. if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified, a dialog to select the scanner will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner. Cancel is & skanlite; exit.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings include more detailed options of the driver. & skanlite; (libksane) does not treat these options particularly.</seg>
<seg id="1169">To scan a picture, the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">To better select the image, the user can zoom in and out of the current selection. it can adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview matches the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">When the image is selected, the final image can be read with the scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">If you preview a preview in the settings before saving, then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below. if Save is pressed, then the image will be saved and Schlie? s will result in a demolition and you will get back to the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1173">The Settings button opens the dialog with the same name before the main window. you can change the most important settings here.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The user can view the image if desired before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not requested by the user then the option must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1175">This setting allows them to select the way & skanlite; images store. open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image. if & skanlite; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder, then you must select Save without asking for a file name.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This setting defines where the images are saved in the Save As option without asking for a file name. if the images are saved after each scan, the folder will be used as default for the Save dialog. the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button... change.</seg>
<seg id="1177">This parameter defines an image prefix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save. the automatically saved image gets a numerical suffix which will be counted every time a picture is stored. the string # # # is replaced by the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1178">The user can adjust the image quality used for saving. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if select the image quality is not selected, then the default value of Qt is used.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; use like all other keyboard shortcuts. below you will find a list of shortcuts and their function. the global keyboard shortcuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Globale keyboard shortcuts. you can set up the & Amarok; select shortcuts with the right mouse button in the player window.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions that are usually found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function might break & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue Loaderror error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the exec () function is mostly used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure switches the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script itself needs to take care of. if a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signifies that a new piece is played. the script could now & b; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume Signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: sub-menu itemTitle paths contain the path to the selected files of the playlist if a custom menu entry is clicked. to add a custom entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM is sent to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as an Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the other modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is complete, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts Page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde apps, you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag and drop music into the playlist, instead of working through endless menus. you may also search for a specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right one to reexperience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">As & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you shouldn't have any trouble with compiling. if you encounter problems, please report this to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Some of the compiler options must be certain dependencies so that they can be used. see System Requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Enabled debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In the player window, the player window will also turn on or off the playlist. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use Voting-barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. the option switches on the experimental function of the moods-barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Design: this function is only available when & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. this changes the color scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Tuning files with music files: this feature is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. if this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored in the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files are stored in & Amarok's preferences folder (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok; to start when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when moving, stores the current playlist automatically when ending & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when moving.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you activate this setting, & Amarok will use; relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date pieces when changing parts causes the playlist window to open / unroll to keep the track always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the piece to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize the look & Amarok; the section is subdivided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; using Select Into Fonts, the otherwise grey section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player windows and context-browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection of user-defined color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playback at the start causes & Amarok; after program start, the playback will automatically continue with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is selected, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors will give you the option to customize the OSD colours for font and background. a click on the color faces opens the dialog for selecting colors. if your own colors are not checked, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Screen option is intended for Xinerama users, allowing you to specify the screen of a multi-monitor environment to display the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output memory card lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers will activate even more setting options in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map file collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed as well as their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; adds all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination-field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: the machine on which the MySql database is located. then under Port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card file provides support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations on the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows & Amarok; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters can be retrieved to the played piece. you can view the list in the context-browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assume that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, for example, fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library for days. you can find the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. then you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok used are compiled libraries with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. shutdown when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically in case of a crash). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-infos but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be re-installed with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s icons in the status bar (random mode / replay / Dynamic Playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the toolbar effects are easily removed. note that in some cases up to three times you have to click a symbol until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: Undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to adjust that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most of the installation problems are easiest by using an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC below irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for troubleshooting. please enter only one error, if you are interested in solving a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears only an empty playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the surface, the Start window has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Tools statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] short commands. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From Playlist Remove From the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there, just like you would do it with other files. it's that simple: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the playlist toolbar, right next to the Add button, you can save the Playlist button. click it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">You probably lack the program xmms-config. install the package xmms-devel and install & Amarok; new. also look for libdocvisual, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses one from the backend independent approach so the actual question must be what media types supports Gstreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support almost every imaginable audio format. Gstreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which does not include MP3 decoder with the default (for patent legal reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST Online Update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & Amarok; play MP3's: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the Gstreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device needs to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (for example, sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a debit with little overhead. Gstreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. Gstreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer Driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable Sound Server with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.X there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver but instead of GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts Puffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less support the visualisations react. yes, this is an error, please help us to fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">Streamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the Streamer driver, crashes & Amarok; from. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After the installation of GStreamer you need to register all the components. run the follow-up register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # gaspamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (exit Amarok before!): - Download Open ffmpeg first, compile and install it. then run all the mpeg files in the Gstreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the gst-config / gstreamer-config) and run svn update. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field to filter the collection will make it easier for you to search for specific pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it with the playlist of the playlist. you will find this button in the playlist toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add it to the playlist browser. if the playlist is in the folder of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (such as RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running track or the current stream. just below is the range, playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch from the available analyzers by clicking the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the scroll display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the play buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or the previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you tick the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions terrify you are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context-browser. on the right side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays different information about the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the sub-window will be omitted. the information presented here is now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras / Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindows music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz-symbol. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the image file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are treated preferentially. the context-browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favourites of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try downloading the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search for google.com according to the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged by performer and below it will be a further split after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted to Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically rerecord your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folder. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar you find a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. references to the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you will find a selection box, which allows you to filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours to a year. you can also select your entire collection, so that the filter is practically shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection Browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This clears the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry will give you the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the media player in the queue for transmission. for more details, see the Media Player Browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trash bin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the list - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears in various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Lift up list - change a album marked as a list back to a normal album. the album will then no longer be displayed under various performers, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling with many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are also possible. click 'Add Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Underwindow media player is used for connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the Interpret list. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, finish & Amarok; and solve the disk connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, enter / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be hard to attach files by simply dropping. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be useful: this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist covers all the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by spaces, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three are found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then complete the search term with goosebumets: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield are looking for, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -some searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries you want. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist toolbar can be found at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions. on the left you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore any changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">A unique, magnifying analyzer is located in the center of the toolbar. the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button. using this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other buttons available for toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up toolbars there....</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking twice in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. through this menu you can access & Amarok settings.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the Visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry contains a submenu with links to this document and other information on & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover Management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The Cover Management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue administration received your big suit in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece in the queue, the playlist will display a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece in the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the dialog's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button Burn, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the Burn dialog can only open if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described about what is the right mouse button (available via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you compile files for a multiple session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this function is not used. it's more likely to be used for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video-DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copy dialog. this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialog. this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialogs is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which will completely delete the content. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Nerus * .nrg files are currently not supported, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for an * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired instantly by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously read DVD video can be converted. this dialog window typically appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and trim black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents are displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents allows selection and dragging of files to the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the key layout further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b device wizard. thus, the correct authorizations can be set to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges can be required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on startup. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & nbsp; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more comfortable Kdcop program. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the included programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all the & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void chanateMovixDVDProject () void chanateMovixDVDProject () void chanateMovixDVD (KURL url) void burnDvd (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can generate a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void shiateFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrl (KURL:: List urls, QString) (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString Newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; it is easy to read audio CDs; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in wav files on hard disk) and by many coding encoding these WAV files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and saved into wav files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggdefault (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything by yourself. however, only the encoding packages must be installed which are needed. if e.g. FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coerers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanics of copy protection. just avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only has to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding software is installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, there are more information on how this program is used as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB query of CD data according to the set-up of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default. note that previously the encoder in the encoder settings tab was configured in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is chosen to encode instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the mode of notifications (such as protocols, pips) for program events (such as read out the & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudio creator; with different cards (such as Encoder, Encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that might be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can replay these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may now have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo devices. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR Common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for the music of adolescents, portable devices and autocosteroids. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or automatically retrieved through the program from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the counter must be added by lame and the title Parameter from & kaudio creator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all the others can download the information rather than enter it into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note that the author is meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being inflicted on the & CD; however, the information without the CD; any more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb you can use another (fake) address than the one used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know it more precisely.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-out WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. more information about the encoder is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudio creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it every time you read a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card file General settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card board CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down selector is simpler, a & CD entry is found, immediately begins reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls command the 8880 protocol by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol usually is open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously sufficient pieces: excuse, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; ejected after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / has to specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. this can be useful if only space is available on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be hidden to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tag for & kde; in case of a later modification of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: at a dual core or Quad core or even a multiprocessor machine can be tempted to encode more than a wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic setup of & kaudio creator; terminated. this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was compiled in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built and the & CD; data from the freedb will be retrieved. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a & CD. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed, just like in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for the questions and answers in the section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and also the name of the artist and the album is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; gives, a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the remainder of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current Title', unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments on the line, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD Editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you are using ID3v2 Tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the coding Settings tab; take a look at the section 'Core Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding and file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to the webpage of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown on the part list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked are read. a simple click on the row turns on or off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click the Selection button to read the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous interpreting and encoding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variations on settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudio creator; however, whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke game of & kde;. besides others, it also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & nbsp; support. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Projector driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play option from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (with multiple pieces, they are added to a collection and then played together.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">When & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item interrupts the playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which uses a song, so that you do not need to manually adjust the entry. however, if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event type, choose from the Settings menu the entries Textereignisse and Song Events. the same function has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the menu Collection under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider this when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add button. in turn, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically Add to Collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If an automatic add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when a piece is opened. then this collection will then be added to the continued items.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the sub-menu order sequence of the Menus collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be set anew.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song, next song next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song back, select the previous piece button, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection you want to delete and click Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI. in this case MIDI-Map converts General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to Bright Piano into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible GM (including Awe and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can support in future versions of & kmid; support may be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is stated how the Patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the Gender Identifier is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and do not omit a line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun, for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum-Patch the patch is meant by which each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards own it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the keymaps, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply change the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyboard will be defined with the name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which relation Pitch-Bender occurrences are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard that receives a pitch-baller event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave up. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, item MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob is no longer green but red in order to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to indicate the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point channel view: configuring</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support is compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, that is why & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag it to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check the Automatically link setting to the collection before. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; counter open & konqueror; windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file just enter the & konqueror; window and drag the file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the Automatically Add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to write on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrose.Jimenez; from Maacute; MÃ ¡laga (Spain). I studied mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy a great joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact under Friends of & kmid; before sending a MIDI file, you should get in touch with me since I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone else. I would like to emphasize that I will only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you use an FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, and to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andochable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Lasting Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you want to create an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not run. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be selected from the View menu and next Edit Mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select from the menu Same with Playlist and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author by & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No intro = 0 'option on' 1 '. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; consider the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would interfere with the end animation, the user can therefore terminate the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; auto: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ gt; & lt; / smilgt; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL supports by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file must be given by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages about loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & SMB; (View, Console, or Console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend is taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been ascertained), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer dialog is the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR - &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by SMBs for the sources different names are used. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is to be executed as root after the device is attached. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom shows the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1744">The & kile; -project contains some pre-compiled packages from & kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are contained on the kile; -page.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support to this project or its documentation is desired, contact should be made via the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions about or when you compile it, or if extensions are desired, this should be addressed to the kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & nbsp; desktop. & kile; offers the ability to use all & latex; features in a graphic interface and within this one simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and powerful project management need to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & works and its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can directly start reading the chapter work with the editor of & items; start.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a layy (bottom lay) & latex; macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good Ã ¼ bersicht to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to control properly, good books, for example, H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, may be consulted in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other signage languages contains & latex; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format, page numbering and text tags are specified as well as a body with text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body begins with the command\\' begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assist by & kile; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. it can also be done some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document Classes: this describes the type of document to be created: articles (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrartcl], projector [beamer], foil [prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: hereby the character encoding is set. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for latex; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN provisions). you should always find use in the creation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& nbsp; offers - just like other source text editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & kile; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that any mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic execution of the environments, by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {Command}) of & kile; automatically a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line for creating the command (e.g.\\ end {Command}). this function can be set in the Settings menu; setup... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. Latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subCOLD the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful for troubleshooting. as soon as a DVI-file is created, jumps & kry; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; Viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output eart of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the support search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; code is clicked on. as soon as click on a section in the & latex; -source code, the corresponding section will be locked in the DVI; Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other included .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick structure: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file will be extended to inter-traineesâ s) and there is no call to & eyepiece; after the fast assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing pane toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Select field is for items such as keywords, notes, or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: with this command a name for a section, an image or another element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is consulted for a project. the author has good experiences with & bibtex; and & bibtex; files can be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the letters of letters. the letters of letters can be set for the main text, the notes of the notes, etc. the following letters are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the letters. if the letters are not set at the beginning, this can also occur later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been entered, the latex can be compiled; the simplest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s construction or the Knopfs FastBuilding.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & kile; automatically excludes storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, should be searched for errors in the log file. if you are using a quick build & eyepiece, you should start automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document. for example, a report with the letters of letters is created 12, and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment}, then allows the change of the lettering within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only taken within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, italics, substrokes, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed in italic with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quotation begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Having the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide is now added to the creation of a document in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. to this end, there should be a quotation, a few spots in fat and italics and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E may return to the editor (internal viewer). an external viewer has to close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format (E V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into wanted other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The initial search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex; binaries. for this, only Modern is to be set up under Settings... Tools Build balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and clicked on the default search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; Viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; open and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using Quick-Building the & DVI-viewer, an error can exist. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log message file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source of error in the source text. in the editor, the LaTeX errors and the most recent LaTeX errors can be used for sprinting between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be re-written or used for quick creation of a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-level users of latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & kile; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Settings in General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSIPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ 'documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSIPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. as soon as the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any type of latex; files are created. if a simple way to create a template, one should search for one on the internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & unique; as internal editor. & unique; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & unique; and to learn its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can directly start reading the chapter work with the editor of & items; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called over the MenÃ ¼ lap LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex word. this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ the\\ bigskip only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the right mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key you can select parts of the source text in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& nbsp; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source-texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can incorporate additional jumping marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu editing springmarks or the corresponding key root causes the jump to the next or last jump stamp. this is also highlighted by this stamp, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & unique; already excellent opportunities offers, have been added in & nbsp; key features for writing a & latex; source code adds many environments and groups and therefore supports & nbsp; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning then includes tables, and latex; commands and all other lines of the source text; the only exploiting thing in & kile; is that the sentences are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also contains latex; -commands with a backslash (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & No; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Delete, the following commands are included for reading the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description for editing select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in latex; therefore offers & kile; for additional commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command closes the last modified environment, so that the nested environment isn't destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is used to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the slated clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group #, the other end of the group will jump (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many bolted groups-clasps, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the last open group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple sign-signs are used as guests. for the purpose-bringing realization, in & nbsp; the sign "is used for two simple sign-signs. also for the completion of the execution the sign" is used. & kile; knows this case and for two close leading signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double quotation marks can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign specific settings can also be used (e.g. german or french) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When Shift is pressed; enter key & kste; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g., enumerate or itemize), & kry; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment close & kile; the current line with\\\\ with a close-ending line break down.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set under Settings; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users would like to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all Et signs (amp;) to each other. & kile; try to make this possible. in case of Shift; Alt; amp; seeks & kile; after the next tab in the following line. although this tab is not the addition, add & kile; some interval for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & works; already a good source code completion offers, this has been added in & kile; to include special commands (mostly for Latex;). three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings... more fully set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} becomes & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, as a result, the complete list of characters can be grasped. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command. alternatively, of & kile, jumps can also be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jumps is possible and the desired parameters can then be consulted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; Setting Up... tile; Completely can make adjustments to these lists. there are different lists of lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as local languages of the general language use are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for complete environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the complete failure mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-space mode over the menu of a full-spaced environment or the key root Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the surrounding conditions can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. as soon as you know it is a list environment, a first\\ item command will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings kile; set up... tile; Completely can make adjustments to these lists. this mode uses the Result List of the Total Commander Mode for & tex; - and Latex; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; Supports user-defined lists of abbreviations which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... Kile can be fully furnished. for example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry is contained L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, when typing the letter L and initiating the word full-time mode over the menu of full-time abduction or the key root Ctrl + Alt Space, the letter L will be replaced with the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large bottoms are not helpful for automatic complete satisfaction. however, it has been found that many protesters are written more than once in a document. therewith, it offers & kile; the complete service for all already written products.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu item Kile. Kile can be fully shutdown. here, the threshold can also be set for the display of complete satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the personal home folder. mode is available for Abbreviation (Abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be followed and taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and re-orders of pages. if the PDF output is solved, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all building tools are grouped together in the menu creation compiling, creating conversions and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewers like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file is converted to a PS file by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Start command a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, each time a new window will open.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... Further, the following information is required for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function by & kile; allows the execution of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DDTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is selected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program, the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree will automatically be opened. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to specify shortcuts (a type of templates) which can be unfolded when editing to larger text. abbreviations are grouped into groups, each one can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from the third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-read-parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, test & quantaplus; if the information entered is correct. selecting it allows saving the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redesigned. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger-plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plug-in drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that displays the content of monitored variables. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Assigns the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debit request is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is requested.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include is broken down.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders include handy, symbolic links from picture buttons (above the editing pane), the text and instructions quickly insert into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbar buttons. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow for quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just one element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the type method. specifies the name of the class to where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute, etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this item is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All tag XML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention & lt; Notes. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a broken leg, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; -windows to start and check tagXML. to select another dialog will appear whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check only takes place when the TagXML files are loaded into & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for achievable DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a list can be selected and DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User defined button, a shortcut can be assigned, with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter. for example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is substituted with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID # number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods enumerated above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the selection box input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">In accordance with the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output, can be specified by setting the value to the default output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action knob at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them, activate the Edit Tag dialog when available so that an input is possible while using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we encounter difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we & kibedit; use. choose from & KMenu;, Graph More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kibedit; used default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually appear as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, send a message to the user that clicking this symbol will insert a & lt; start; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbars to set dialog via Settings Toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (on the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by masturbating all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please customize their file descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a PHP and PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc., then you must create the docrc file. let's leave the first part to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html... [Context] ContextList = func1, func2 = func.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the Documentation Tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; Documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folders displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file used to display context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not get rich about it but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">Mit & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the discard resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">Resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbars with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus, users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team takes them as accurate and useful for publication. in order to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which it is necessary for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can stay empty) and start clicking OK the upload starts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD Package (DTEP), upload toolbars toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message will appear with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format might be necessary. there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the Menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file using the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitional line: the string that appears in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after converting the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them precisely these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three sections: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to back up different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emit the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card reader with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tabs, reload, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as editing / pasting / inserting, editing the tags in the mouse pointer, help to the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in their document, then click the symbol representing the tag. now you can enter the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and to roam. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the breakdown in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script. by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with EMail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresh the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. the infeed system, which is aligned to the content, enables the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. thus, for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the toolbar of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & nbsp; 3 is located in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, would be an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & nbsp; developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why Developing What someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; so expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible. by the program Kommander, they can be extended, without having to memorize any script language syntax. (read more about them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpfull help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there included special characters to the & HTML; depreciation, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL; depreciation, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP script reports error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Activating and activating the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecasts or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar, which only creates the name. actions must be saved using the Settings... Toolbars will be saved through toolbars toolbar or you will be asked whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this will not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download an & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the DTEP should be refreshed without the entire & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags Edit menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent paste means that & quantaplus; inserting tool bar refuses when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plugins are listed among the menu items listed above. you activate them. click on an activated plug-in to disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the original version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the changeover can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card file mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus, the main window or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will influence every application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Performs the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of & works, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled up from top to bottom, since e.g. after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name of the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.ex.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adaptation might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu in the lower window or with Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the above, including files listed in .cvsignor, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Lower window profiles high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by showing a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, and quantaplus, the last project that was open. currently, this behavior cannot be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or icon Project from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files finds. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu called with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be hidden to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unsecure password saved on the disk -option is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply dipping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted using the Project toolbar menu or the Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to boost productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best customizable using the Tools toolbar. using and Add toolbars will be treated at the bottom of the Add toolbars section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar) in which, with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbars can be renamed or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action labeled, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings Toolbar... and setting actions settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files, etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents by links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the tree template.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment using a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file to a template folder only. it can be used for all file management functions such as dragging and dropping or inserting on the tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-set headers and footers or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert files or associate with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop down selector with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or featured templates for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with matching headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have context menu (show right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source editor that can be reached from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back if necessary to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandscape of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor, and PHP; to edit, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the VPL; the cursor runs in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... By selecting VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">If you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this is also possible to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this serves to reduce the manual coding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click in the list allows the modification of the content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change to the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the selection works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbars as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, for example, if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables assistant or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indent at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows resolving conflicts and at the same time display the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & # diff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& # diff3; shows the exact differences and denies the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more anger if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual typing of file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog remembers your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & # diff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it above a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you'd only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do nothing from & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info row has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflict in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the locations where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line will be scored dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has a info line with the inscription output:, the file name and [structure] if you have edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also create a jump of the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each to the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more line remains in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the queue; indicated. this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe again select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, or in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging conflicts; however appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters as well.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page from, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-figure Forward / Ctrl-figure Forward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you select, automatically copied to the clipboard and manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-forward character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line endings of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when finished and restored next time. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an uneven color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copying in the clipboard will be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Comparing files attempts & kde3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, other again save only a newline '\'. usually ignores & kde3; the chariot return character is made visible, however, as a white character is treated. during merging, this option must be disabled. in default, this will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensely after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Choose A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflict from the merging menu. note that the Automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and executing a merge. see documentation on the directory comparison and merge for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version will be attached to the Suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must & # diff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is checked, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a short notice appears what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or summary columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; -GT; C or B & lt; -GT; C is displayed next to the normal yet another oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply drop the less important windows. (this option is in the Window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide not to merge the files. the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last file file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a regular pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command line. the output of the command is only used for line breaks. you can write your own pre-processor exactly matching your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line alignment to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a freeze expression of the text found on each string. the\\ 1 converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword created text $. now, a pre-processing command for line offset is needed. you can change the list as needed. you can change the list as needed. the\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another command line for line separations. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Enforcement / Switch 'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. the subsequent operations will only change the data that the newline algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for merging for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... simulates the merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you need to specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, folder 3 is used as a destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files that have been compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3 displays; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to open all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green then becomes yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & # diff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option Newer file instead of merging (unsure) is checked, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files, but the same date appears error: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such bugs are not fixed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging one file is processed after the other. you status column shows skill when merging was successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpected occurs. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merging actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then C is used as the target in the Three-Folder merging mode, B is chosen as a target while syncing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merging / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merge actions still exist by conflicting file types, a message will appear indicating the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will pop up with options Conduct, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select to start / continue directory merging again or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then you execute & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a bug, a message appears and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge together (F7 key), you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were merged individually, the entries (in the current session) will not merge again. even if the merging has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered settled. only if you change the merging action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be typed more than a sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be typed more than a sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvindicate file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a predefined dot selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in an endless loop and & # diff3; crashes down.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-sample.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered as identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful e.g. if the modification date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging will be selected so that both folders are identical. the results of merging files will be saved in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action. (this is considered insecure, because it assumes the knowledge that the other file is not modified.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and preserves the extension .original If an old backup file already exists with the .orig enlargement, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merging of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view will be visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn off the directory & text window into the main window in the Window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly from the merging menu. as soon as you save the result, the status is set to replace and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost if you re-read the directory: list -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit credentials or change date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first with the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & # diff3; then remove & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it heats accomplices) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool Collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines will be next to each other, this paris paris paris often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too great so far. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly; No src is swept; released and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& # diff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thanks!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system using & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir checks the folder in your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have problems with compiling. should you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position resp. replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function after making changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This will also mean that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain those files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled by default. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, quit them or move them. this works in both a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both a desktop as well as on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button clicks is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager set up... and Finish. if however, click on an application within & Kpager; the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; view the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is selected together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is selected, the running programs are shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems only.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classic leaves & pager; in a 2 x grid, as well known from Pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move windows as icons or with its contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then setting up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowTransparentMode and assign it to this one. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key or the & MMB; use it, you can move the selection box.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer resides in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (repetitive-impanzine-injury syndrome) and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the cursor freezes for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate dragging with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain associated with the use of your computer may also help you scan a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The intelligent shift activates, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before letting the mouse button run. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligently moves on, the Rotary Move Time (1 / 10 s) is active. here time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button waits before the mouse button starts again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse cursor. if this function is enabled, a slow moving moves to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; then go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, and kmousetool; at every start of & kde; start. this function is currently only under & nbsp; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the user is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times from & kde; to decrease with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which positions a mouse click does not have any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can use the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can be scratched easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; when a move has just started. if you use the intelligent move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by letting the mouse button finish.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you and kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to select text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this way each time & kmousetool; the mouse button clicks a sound like a mouse click away. so you know exactly when when smart moving starts moving time. later, you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; that should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The function of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer resides. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those suffering from the bristest pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released. thus dragging and dropping with the mouse can be done.</seg>

<seg id="2531">With the program & mouth; dumb users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that should be discussed again.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot), enter the command later used for the speech output of text. see the Setup dialog for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page you can choose the standard textbook. from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them. text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot), you determine the word for the word-permitting. & mouth; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words. in addition, you can copy the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words can be recorded in the words of the word.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & mouth; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a disk space of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have a mouth, you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear. each spoken sentence is attached to the disk space. you can select sets that should be re-spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry Settings kmouth; set up... open the settings dialog from & mouth; this dialog includes two card cards, voice output and settings, page Worterephase and the page KTTSD language service.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the voice output voice output, enter the command to call the voice generator. in the drop-down box below the input field, specify the character encoding, with the text passed to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& mouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed to the voice generator as the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command for voice output depends on your voice generator. you can find this command in the documentation of your voice generator. examples for this can be found in the appendix.</seg>

<seg id="2543">With the first selection box action after selecting a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by the shortcut or by selecting a text passage in the textbook textbook or in the box for text passbooks.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of In stock, the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory. with the selection of Add to the input field, the selected text passage will be entered only into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">The second drop-down selector for the text passbook allows you to specify whether the text passcode book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window.</seg>
<seg id="2546">With the selection of text passcode book, the book is saved. if you choose to reject changes, the textbook is not saved. choose before saving to ask, will & mouth; ask if the textbook is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="2547">The Worterephase page contains a list of worktops for the word completion. in the main window beside the input field, you can see and mouth; a drop-down selector, if this list contains more than one dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page, you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">For this source, select the desired language; & mouth; then reads the & kde; documentation. the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & mouth; ask then which dictionaries are merged, and how these dictionaries should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option you insert a new, empty dictionary without entries. since & mouth; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary, you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main section of the window for editing text passageways is divided into two parts. in the upper part, the textbooks are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Adding actions such as new text passages or books or deleting selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting in the menu bar, toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The sequence of text passageways or text passages can be changed by dragging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the & Alt; key.</seg>

<seg id="2612">In & Konqueror;, the web browser by & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed web page. first check the text you want to read and select Tools Text from the main menu. after a short time, the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page. you can also skip this step, but then many & HTML; prestressing lines and other invisible brands are also read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & works, the expanded text editor of & kde; you can read the text displayed. first check the text you want to read and select Tools Text from the main menu. then the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This works also when & items; embedded in other applications, such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The Notify is the message system from & kde; it notifies you about events you set. you can also read the text of this message by & tts.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & conversation;, the IRC program of & kde; you can set up various types of messages. for example, you can set up a message when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & kton, you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; program notification, a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for the Notify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is part of the scope of supply of & tts; is a good example. it removes tags br and b from messages sent by mail, and also the expression / local / inbox, since it can be assumed as provided in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & kton; for normal work with & tts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech program. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to substitute false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to handle certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech "speech" program works with a text. & kton; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these jobs. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can with & mouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you receive from the map file is a text job. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text orders. text entries are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except for Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & kton; just one such reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character string placer replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is supplied with predefined string replacement filters such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery & tts; some XSLT files are available for translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & kton; for example, if you have set a female voice on the map file speaker, you can read text by KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text job, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further down-down dialogues will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string selection filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these samples are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the speaker is speaking one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & Dbus; -numbers must omit you. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 shows, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expression in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions. & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; prints can be found in the package of deutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; transducers translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such forms. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the microphone selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card reader, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & tts; passes a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program prefers the text to & kton; the speaker will be selected and the features of the speakers configured on the card file are selected.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system der & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; printouts, you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click on the button to the right to view the Speaker selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The subscriber selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde; enables programmers to give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & Dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so you can use this synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -Dbus; interface of the voice output API from & kde; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; reformulation filter, but when using the module for the festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta you have to install the (male) voice rab _ diphone to make SABLE at all. you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found over the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain notes or punctuation marks appear to cause errors in the synthesizer so that whole sentences are skipped or only Kauderwelsch is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be remedied by a string replacement filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2677">Speech-Dispatcher program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand it, you can connect to the developer team for the use of another synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, compile, you need a recent development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer), including the kdelibs and the development files for the speech software program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdebug, or downloaded the recently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start & kton; check first whether speech-Dispatcher is working properly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& kton; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the speech. the kttmsg program is to be developed in such a way that speech memory is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences, allowing the user to return puncture or paragraph mode, pause, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application contains text on & tts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is female English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is selected. if you want to learn more about how & kton; a speaker chooses, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Spokesman on Add, and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the map file speaker setup will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the string for text passed to the festival. in the case of voices, the & tts, this setting is automatically done. in general, Western languages ISO 8859-1 are used, Eastern languages such as Czech and Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you can adjust volume, speech speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulators and display this grey, the chosen voice does not allow you to select these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to load due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with larger memory usage).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, kttsmgr will be displayed when you start kttsmgr. otherwise, only the kttsmgr icon in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text, so you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card file speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below, before or return. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) will be taken over and tsmgr will be reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card-card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text job is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language assignments:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the screen reader has been read, the reserved orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you have & eg; just let a long text read on a website, you can with & mouth; still welcome someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text job is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, add & tts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is then played when a normal text job is interrupted. if both sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and screen readers' issues, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & tts; notify messages, run kttsmgr and click Notifications. the board map notifications appear.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for control of voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. in addition, brands for control of pronunciation, for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & tts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / synthesis.dtd"]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filter (SDB-Filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sets. thus you can start reading faster with the pre-read, since only the first set has to synthesize, or stop or stop jobs, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the punctuation filter. at the first start of & kton, a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add other set limit recognition filters, but beginners will be advised of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the simplest way, you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch jobs, which speaker & kton, on the card board, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster to start reading, because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop or abort orders on the map file, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement code recognition filter is automatically set up when you start tsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The punctuator recognition filter matches text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are removed automatically from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal movement recognition filter from Versee, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Speaker menu card selection, you can override the microphone settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card reader). in other words, there are no speaker properties specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">If you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & kton; otherwise select & kton; the speaker that most likely matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as the primary attribute. you will rarely use this property. the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one placed in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click the Standard Speaker select button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text job in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Cast Streamer is crash and & tts; it has been finished. you probably have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x, the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is probably installed. you can try updating or uninstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text job, it freezes & kti; a. on the & console; appears a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but tsmgr does not show that voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktesd / festivalint / Voices, add the new voice. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be traceable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker equipment. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speed settings are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; previews. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) disable either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML reshaping filter, and set up the Speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded & tts; as tarball (with tar packed archive), log in as a normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4, the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a running time dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2768">Before you start, check first if your voice synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & kton.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help find the instructions included with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes the festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in the festival / lib / x / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter for the voices of MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding, such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the Linux & Linux distributions. so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the option encoding must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option encoding must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic like KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MMBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full language sharing system is. & MBROLA; generates language from diphon files. you need additional software to create this dephone. Festival generates this from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also generate from German text slides.</seg>
<seg id="2778">With this procedure, additional wrapper code is added to Festival to use & MBROLA; -Voices for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in & MBROLA; files, but in the folder festival / lib /.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkc.; a module for the & kcontrolcenter; this allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkc.conf package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from & kcontrolcenter; the & knetworkc.conf file; creating a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation, a new module network settings are displayed in & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkc.;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkc.; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that & knetwork.conf; the device at all indicates and setting the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in the installation of & Linux; installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; Index. when starting the module network settings, this will try to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and the release level. by selecting Not-again questions the setting can be permanently hit. the next start of the network settings then automatically preset this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning that the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the bottom right of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the rider Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of indicated network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to be set up in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified. in the netmask input field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can find out if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switch on an outdated network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching off an activated network device will be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS replaces this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the holder's name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons on or down in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the Add... button from the group to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. then the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select an entry from the group Calculator for the name resolution and then click the Edit button.... It is displayed in the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name-known calculator describes the name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when there are no DNS servers available. in small, completed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of name-known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos, and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit.... The Create computer dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, you have to set the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used as a kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetworkc.The following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technique is given, in the second one will discuss all of & knetwork.conf; variable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread use. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point that assigns a valid IP address or, if available, can be used by DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a designated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, most of the addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that have been affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is automatically sorted by the scripts in SuSE. another stand than expected may occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to save several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packaging. the second objective was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & nbsp; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; retrains the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & dat; don't recognize the pre-tensioning force on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & dat; the pre-tensioner, search for the right index on your disk. can't it be found, you will be asked if the index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; passes through a change of the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & nbsp; it must be formatted by & dat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape must be formatted before use, this must happen before you are formatted by & nbsp; Floppy tape drives generally do not require formatting of the tape, DAT drives are not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost! after finishing the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>

<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that should be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be installed separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The Settings menu can be set up using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-winding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command will mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read- or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try to lock the ejector at the tape drive. this setting may not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it will automatically be ejected when the & dat connection is released; the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tried & kdat; the hardware-specific block size for the tape drive is changed. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to tell & dat; in any case, share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file directory.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which are directly associated with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & nbsp; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, and ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it enables & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. among others include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog provides functions with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start attempts & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if you do not display it, and it will open instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not started with system administrator privileges. under Linux, log files usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string. the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed, so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then compared only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so you will see and ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of the step error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as a protocol line of the step Note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the Filter Panel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new line in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocols.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log in the menu to view it.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find further up-to-date information on the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named as) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful yet more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. & Linux; kernel looks at first on / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. There you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you will need a script for every system service you want to run at startup of the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something remotely with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for the program at different points and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run level 3 is. if you want to change this, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you do something on the inittab. if you do something, then you will be able to repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do all the right scripts start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would persist the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveline or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will not happen only if they extract an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved when you move them to a new area. simply select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target zone -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The item number of an entry cannot sometimes be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to a different runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use CTRL; X) and paste it into the desired run level with Paste (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runoivelines, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files do not exist or are incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser;.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two board cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user / group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card file will be created, where you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management board map appears if shadow passwords are installed, for example, / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card file only appears if for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card file groups are informed about the group members of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you can find in the field PrimmoPA. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
