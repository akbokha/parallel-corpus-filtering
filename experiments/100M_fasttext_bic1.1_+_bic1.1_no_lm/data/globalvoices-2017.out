although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; me it was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensi@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sham@@ eful love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , expres@@ sing his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not agree with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also contra@@ sts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fought the environment for their lives , and their husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still suits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Pan@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump launched its way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ ided over a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as ra@@ cists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in another way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
could it be that those elect@@ ors , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , it is hard to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man looking down contemp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note d . ) : as much as &quot; rebel@@ lion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise , saying : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this , I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices grew lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music with g@@ arbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what did the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in the O@@ ax@@ aca province share with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 , an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest of the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gang violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga to play .
music from waste
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located on top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers led by F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all from g@@ arbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article published by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , commemor@@ ates the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of recycled material that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ er@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates approximately one billion tons of ru@@ bb@@ ish .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of g@@ arbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© FISH @-@ i Africa - a project to fight wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated underground fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to visit one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u is a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; that &apos;s why we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate violation of existing laws , by means of which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing have once been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , which circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions nowadays happen in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able on a FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . even susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship is transporting its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports based on this information . meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm advoc@@ ating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the platform already mentioned was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , losing eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license documents , f@@ anta@@ sies of f@@ anta@@ sies , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You cannot run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Com@@ m to me . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole attempt to close FISH @-@ i now .
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it discovered criminal networks that had spread f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international association for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help FISH to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers a technical support to FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . FISH @-@ i should help to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can the FISH @-@ i &apos;s team actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed world @-@ wide by the position of each tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of who is doing what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run where a global system allows the pursu@@ it of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect crimes , but also deter them .
ships that used to f@@ ake without licence and hardly expected consequences know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i have reached a 33 % increase in F@@ ish@@ eries , since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i had helped Somalia , the insp@@ ectors were there on board tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually pass through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a vessel that was flying under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without licence and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now forbidden .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fisher@@ man from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ y@@ 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is further intensi@@ fying : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the discharge of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness , when they assembled themselves on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ yard of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation wor@@ sens continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the discharge of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence belong to the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching short@@ age of food and medicine , the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called for a large majority of opposition representatives after the 2015 elections , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , planned to continue blocking the referendum on the term of office .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others as follows :
it is far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; The Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time bear witness to the overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who is calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images which relate to disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mal@@ treatment are accum@@ ulating on Twitter .
especially large waves beat the message of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira have no skirts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which covers the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for an administrative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs add :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado asser@@ t that 1 % of sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your discharge !
on the road !
others are evalu@@ ating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and rather pre@@ fers to aband@@ on critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than working or shopping .

in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tort@@ ur@@ er and a mur@@ derer .
Luis did not have a choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a polic@@ eman . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the Secret Service department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
recording of the archive .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who is accused of kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kid@@ n@@ apping a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ enko &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t forget that they don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revolution@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine .
at the base of the military , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tort@@ ured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch that men were tort@@ ured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it out with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ Ã³n Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the st@@ ench there was aw@@ k@@ ward ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell at once again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a man to hurt another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye band@@ ages .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
next to La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survi@@ vors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be rel@@ oc@@ ated .
this was a lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Batt@@ les@@ &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they knew - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military emblem , which you have fought an enemy you fought .

but if you go to a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
this is my Father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover out of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defense of being a con@@ spir@@ ator accused me of being a crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to pre@@ dict .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children dec@@ eive ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people .
did these people also have families to whom you could hand over their mort@@ al remn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act that can be done to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of showing my father was born during a meeting when he was placed under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they suppos@@ edly def@@ ended , were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I reported the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally spoken out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including serious illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
in Spanish , the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera was ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court sentenced life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , Tort@@ ure and R@@ ape through counter@@ s . # Es@@ bri@@ tish terrorism
all the def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kid@@ n@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he taught the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J@@ .O@@ .@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be built there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where you can extend your driving license last month are witnesses to a particularly mis@@ erable translation .
on a shield the Japanese word used to be the &quot; old mot@@ orists &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ bel@@ ow@@ a ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil h@@ ind thoughts and # 8@@ 212 ; translated as a &quot; terrible car driver . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt ins@@ ul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ Cast News diver@@ ted somewhat more extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country are worried .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors , representing a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents altogether .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the name un@@ named rep@@ orter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error has among others the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so faul@@ ty is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are multi@@ fac@@ eted .
to over@@ ride , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and pro@@ active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
a French native speaker , for example , should translate from English into French - not French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native speakers who could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can nevertheless make translations in the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases produced by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling print@@ outs that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : take protests and break @-@ ups on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ itters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are again locked by Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet providers .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tel@@ ecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to force . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the Internet site at which the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds er@@ ron@@ eous or ref@@ uses to request the request of such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who took the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported to regulate Internet connections , making access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness statements of other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , which became exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of structural engineering .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of structural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house once more and heard the owner of the house with pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as one calls in Paraguay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , education and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend countless day hou@@ se@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ min@@ ac@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous dis@@ comforts of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organisation fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as guarantees in general not to be silent .
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
if the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it for many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households has got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived at Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of heavy b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military associate Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the registration office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra ended up with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered a fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ b .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they marked the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest conferences and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; to be present in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighb@@ ors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ b .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be land@@ mark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the daily life of a cri@@ b
the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as a cri@@ b .
in her employer &apos;s home , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ists of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read leading articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
while he was intelligent , he did not enter@@ tain her . &quot; the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they often didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who is part of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ &apos;s indigenous group , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ back home .
their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had made for her .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ b .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job adverti@@ sements for cleaning personnel and child girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the heart@@ land that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author turned on once again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to report Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ es , Or@@ ti@@ z writes :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , and the system of the Mens@@ Ãº ( in which the workers were treated as half @-@ slaves ) and that many girls and boys will go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power represent the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up that is commissioned to use citizens permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their correct names and ID numbers on the website in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a cash bu@@ ck .
the draft bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and c@@ ens@@ ored in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration on them . it is uncle@@ ar how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Sad@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Tel@@ ecommunic@@ ation Ministry to enter the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; leading research technolog@@ ist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I have no doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose minds the control is maxim@@ ized and will ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was en@@ vis@@ aged for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natur@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war drawn by war

this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , which runs through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leopard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist Raz@@ a enjoys a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals are set up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

early March 2017 documented the progress made for the northeast of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced into force because the ts@@ un@@ ami had destroyed entire coastal towns on the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture did not yet experience an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been made six years later in order to re@@ build the local life .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements ( including the H@@ ump@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) pre@@ fec@@ tures were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was achieved by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
nevertheless , six years after the disaster , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of bar@@ ren accommodation ( the leading of the United States of the United States of Kaz@@ akh@@ stan ju@@ te ac@@ u ) is still to be rel@@ oc@@ ated to final re@@ plac@@ ements .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful at this stage . more than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ uation homes cul@@ min@@ ated in homes after disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate this figure is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune had opened their doors up to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma res@@ um@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been largely affected by the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , where only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land can be re @-@ used in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear shel@@ tered zone .
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far ab@@ rupt .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it harder to make their living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feel has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
what about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has raised its attention to the situation of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was witnessed by the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement buildings .
since 2017 , there are still some 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation circuits are older than 50 years old . it is well known because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it appears at first sight .
these global compounds are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly inter@@ connected with someone over language and country boundaries .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being hit with nation@@ wide demonstrations by the police
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva at a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student aged 33 years old was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ dea hit him with a striking stick against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of G@@ oi@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred it to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active service until the final examination of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes at G@@ oi@@ dea with his striking stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer could be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from G@@ oi@@ dea , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks shortly afterwards hur@@ ry to it .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ ran@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police brut@@ ality . &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in G@@ oi@@ Ã¡s :
G@@ oi@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here we have sab@@ ot@@ aged a busy school with a gas le@@ ak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a striking stick .
police raid over
G@@ oi@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers staged protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against prot@@ esters via loud@@ speakers .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on a different , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo ad@@ mi@@ red specifically about a broken glass window to depic@@ t their titles as illustr@@ ative with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus caught fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of material damage .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police is conce@@ aled by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational dis@@ course with the police . &quot;
villages forgotten by the de@@ commissioning of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ y@@ nos@@ o law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba opened doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich Municip@@ ality , which is located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter of fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar crop on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete rum@@ our remained .
about 272 workers had to rein@@ vent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute every day to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s pl@@ agues , socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer news anymore .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agri@@ cultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban President Fi@@ del Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time working group .
before the first year of exile , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents which differ@@ ed only with respect to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ isse Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , with Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important job vac@@ anci@@ es has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the systems in the communities in which they were present were created .
we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .

after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory concluded , or rather , when they began to un@@ mask it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region at once .
in the area a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have been tor@@ ment@@ ing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement at 65 years , not because he is lacking in strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations students use hip hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been offering mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e Communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop calls for the young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ frontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called the Highway of T@@ ears , a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers did not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following hymn that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on cre@@ e .
the young people involved got a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , giving them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also go ahead with our youth
this is how they can do what it has intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( one of their own ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed in the vicinity of the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( all of the way ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sculp@@ tural models of dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . a new trend , however , is turning it into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ gel@@ u .
now in special selling : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic pan@@ es as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ecti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin &apos;s fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming more and more elaborate .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form so as to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ low ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand bands made of dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # of all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and murdered regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Kart@@ ell , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Poly@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ dy que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ed Life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves , to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he was to be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me here too .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her , because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter in which form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent to this or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ ffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders when walking through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months exhaus@@ tion in the capital district &quot; : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed crimin@@ als squee@@ zed money out of her business month by month until they had destroyed their family apart in the end .
you think of everything that you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she made her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you .
I wonder@@ ed in these terrible days whether wines would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Bry@@ an is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , make potatoes , keep tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; Chi@@ cco &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood was ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like this :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Civil Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mor@@ ds per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Poly@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country during the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he is linked include pictures on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to make trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the site S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the Civil War , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been negl@@ ected for years and devast@@ ated it . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
the official representatives described a fire@@ ball , which covered dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people looking at the football world championship .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated for un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of reduced bodies which are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years the same photo has been viewed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted figur@@ atively on the basis of satellite images .
the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win Land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ write @-@ ups ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the drawing from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash@@ point , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following that brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page fal@@ sely claim@@ ing that the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein said that mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to view this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated the image from DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling reach back into the years of 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far information can pass boundaries .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed @-@ mask private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published . thus , we want to illustrate the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ usive use may origin@@ ate from the countries listed below ( which have also been inter@@ connected in some cases ) .
here are some cases which can now be completely tra@@ cked ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copies of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available in the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread for the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo , expres@@ sing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be prosec@@ uted , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government issued a justi@@ fication for what they considered as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
this correction , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to f@@ ake images of rum@@ or molecules that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims that kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has granted Th@@ ein its 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo showed , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ed ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated from the emb@@ assy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo .
there are more confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( in the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the craw@@ ler and isolated they have image file names linked to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of mis@@ - and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ing readers and viewers , and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake news . &quot; they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from the context or completely ab@@ usive way .
however , each investigation of false represent@@ ations should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photographer Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses the CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ c@@ ers ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish So@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resist@@ s every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand precisely what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Van@@ u@@ at@@ u Mw@@ ab@@ ol language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get your parents in recognition of how you have endeav@@ oured in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
or@@ ators of Treas@@ ure Languages , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya came across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud wave .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas were slowly coming back .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos show an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever , warns the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ ds , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five will be completed for transporting emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also been cleared up to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood conditions and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital substances for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ap@@ tur@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 74@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 to help animals in this area .
the Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app asks worried people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched an SOS button , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help people in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now im@@ min@@ ent the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we still call par@@ ole for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next we are en@@ vis@@ ing rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied out of an American flag , others sk@@ etch slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girl@@ friend watches me and says : &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? , &quot; I ask .
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
they kid@@ n@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are ab@@ duc@@ ed .
the ab@@ duc@@ ation of the kid@@ n@@ apping
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you mind when you think of it ?
love ? love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western vision the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I saw how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ eth reality , which in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exer@@ ts his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative we@@ aken Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ w@@ lessly that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ viral attacks and attacks .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell tales that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is an African @-@ American citizen .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the 1976 author@@ ess in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had rep@@ lied the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were wounded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my mus@@ li@@ mic recipes out or my hand@@ ker@@ chief which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are being produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with fin@@ anc@@ ers , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islamic x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger that we@@ ars a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , attitude and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ending ritual with my daughter when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verse to the protection that seals the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mother@@ ly with her sisters ; how to win a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in that moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah , my only Lord , is Allah .
for a people that - for centuries - has been colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire &quot; that has founded a company called Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ in@@ die Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was we@@ eping for his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at play .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first bom@@ b@@ ings of the history of history were thrown off a century over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

to my mus@@ li@@ m strain of 1.7 billion people goes deep into our unforgettable family trees , our in@@ born history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered over each continent from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy comes home to the US and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded airports to fight against Muslim Ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American is a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but fail to communicate with others .
the 1.7 billion nar@@ ration contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons er@@ ect structural Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from just the countries that bom@@ bs it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and neb@@ ulous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely aimed at Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we carry and the bom@@ bs that we reject Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories that we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically incorrect picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we Have to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous visual prints we use in our news@@ letters .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing von Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ IC , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all of this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now run the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
they had not yet given them a few years before , and now they are ruling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ cili@@ ations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged and people are un@@ vei@@ led by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was even scientific to Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , Fo@@ under of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land , the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , is the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is linked to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , to feel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format story @-@ narr@@ ator put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and depic@@ tion lead to the recognition of the audience .
they call forth laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ or Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ o@@ at in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the US re@@ constitution of sovereign debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ orium Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church council Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demanded that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial audi@@ ts and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests to public debt , with a fixed remun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ mailing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to settle with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night guard for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books made by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; produced within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective post@@ research ) .
the book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of ess@@ ays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for sharing knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprison@@ ed in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he was lod@@ ged on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police had taken a Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who took notice of themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technolog@@ ist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything under it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ en but the world .
this campaign in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be of in@@ valuable importance for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the Internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was det@@ ained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting ey@@ es@@ ight ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment when we embrace
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say f@@ are@@ well
and I will let another piece of my soul be with you ...
I swi@@ ft@@ ly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

the history of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the use of violence were tort@@ ured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International since 2011 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our demand for the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : alleg@@ ations of corruption convic@@ ted director after release on previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half his sentence , in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ end@@ ants due to im@@ pur@@ ities of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al .
the money came from public funds from the Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose council presented Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no grounds for Cam@@ ba@@ za to reg@@ ain his old post , as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integration da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , shortly CIP ) condemned the decision of the company to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
however , the company was apparently silent and did not take reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been dem@@ ol@@ ished .
he could hold paid spe@@ eches and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already ins@@ ul@@ ted so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks the mor@@ als to return and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves to the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is imprison@@ ed :
thi@@ eves are imprison@@ ed in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , d@@ ashing and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he strongly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reactions were negative in Twitter :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he sat for 10 years and was free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; the &quot; tra@@ ffi@@ cker &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts discussing the use of the word have been c@@ ens@@ ored in order to express their use .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ect@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook had to be analy@@ tic before del@@ eting all posts suspected of dis@@ semin@@ ating rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ e@@ Book .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next to it .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared the opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
c@@ ens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
it also seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and prohibited such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebooks auto c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and don &apos;t consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate language but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where con@@ front@@ ations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but rather than c@@ ens@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at it better in context than on code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and lear@@ nt from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the nur@@ ser@@ y
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ dd@@ lers are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the old age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 there was a large public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , assembled the representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not interfere since that , &quot; age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , which defines min@@ ors as &quot; anyone under the age of 18 . &quot;
the UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who have already been married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , was 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements endeav@@ ored to abol@@ ish laws on the to@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
but not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition arose for tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill altogether .
yet at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who was enth@@ r@@ alled , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law declare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws on the to@@ e were finally am@@ ended .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ises the core of the matter , but know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel was of opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , Excellent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed have agreed to the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the to@@ dd@@ lers in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are not allowed by law any more .
it was a long battle ( ... ) Car@@ rier Re@@ vi@@ val .
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
months ago , Mah@@ ar@@ aj ple@@ aded his intention to take legal action , and the law was to be passed , and he seems to have fulfilled his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi was a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , it was quite ri@@ ght@@ ful if Mah@@ ar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wish that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , stu@@ b@@ born men who are in the advantage to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in various grades , although there are laws that forbi@@ d them .

on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosec@@ utor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day becomes more clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and TV series fans defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform stopped all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on domain names and thus makes complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation and only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ sol@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and employee at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one access@@ es another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ hl@@ ting r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ et@@ own right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was just at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the river Rap@@ ti .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to cra@@ p pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities to gain global recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood face to face to Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the bush suddenly appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es at the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for pillar &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to speak the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of their social pressure they should respect the husband as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a pseu@@ do @-@ court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name , too , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ sh in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals as well as hou@@ se@@ wives , presented a unique club and were thus quickly become the main topic of conversation in the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the delic@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the degra@@ dation of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to discover practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people , and guides these clubs .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion rounds was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not saying al@@ oud to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as being left behind , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on .
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they spoke about their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she could only gig@@ gle over the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc red dot on the foreh@@ ead that shows the sp@@ ouses :
why only do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the in@@ toxic@@ ated point if he would also do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lun@@ ches and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine cour@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own dress code , mor@@ ality connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear it .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the assurance that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we &apos;re talking about and what we &apos;re doing .
we all sit in the same boat .
the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers Community come from isolated groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages from those who experience themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the H@@ ash@@ tag ( Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) was to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit in 2016 :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here are quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well known Japanese sizes achieved its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! &quot; Today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is meant to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places associated with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

young bald men are kid@@ n@@ apped and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que target of attacks .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping bald persons for organ retail , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia found the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country carried out a mission to examine this practice .
persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who were going to go to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are aiming for ritual attacks , the mos@@ que police warned of the latest assass@@ ination of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ bla@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rit@@ uals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this also attract the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blog medium Armen Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I LOVE RI@@ DER@@ N A mos@@ que that the people would have shame on going on the street , dressed as if they would be ashamed of the recordings of a por@@ no@@ film in which the teachers would indul@@ ge in good marks , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald ones are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , Human Rights Watch Scienti@@ st for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the leader of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
Mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald people .

in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who were self @-@ insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open Web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , thus the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forced by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for live cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( National endanger@@ ment ) , after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he considers it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have cri@@ tici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some foreign reactions .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government concluded that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to restart the Sal@@ mon on China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top se@@ al@@ ings of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she stated in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family .
they shall meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the emb@@ assy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the request of the US emb@@ assy moved into an angry response from China to itself , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to intervene in a single and ir@@ responsible comment on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Switzerland , Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex around Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer declared AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of speech and freedom of incorpor@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France would eventually receive it .
Taiwan City of Taiwan
the Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and to show greater tolerance to those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with a statement on June 28 around Li@@ u and indicated that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 which stand for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ le , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domination of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ le were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in the face of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , fors@@ aken the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cus were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he would disgu@@ ise such questions with non @-@ answers of rational forms .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ le to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our ad K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ le would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that it was paid up in order to be part of the city of Singapore .
while An@@ on has published his comments on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cus &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cus , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Singapore &apos;s Minister of Justice said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ le , a member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ dul@@ ously make a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fre@@ udi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are viewed only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cus are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore tends to be a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours covering certain parts of the world and presenting another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook inside anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighb@@ ors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be fun - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian double Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can b@@ ump .
to be harmless means to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zing Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that de@@ codes the j@@ un@@ ta who took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what prec@@ ep@@ ts he makes his girl@@ friend .
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly refers to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the videos that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setting up &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime whose vag@@ ue and uncle@@ ar prec@@ ep@@ ts are often exploited by the authorities to arrest ar@@ rests and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity was set up in the army , which monitors and prosec@@ utes the online content and persons , accused of being exp@@ elled from the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a strict fight against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty &apos;s ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 , war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to pursue is buying expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ables .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , which im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the cl@@ er@@ ics in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ go@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ dock of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russi@@ ans , Greeks , Amor@@ gos , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russi@@ ans are living in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ er@@ ks .
this phenomenon is characteristic of the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district ac@@ counted for 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly climb@@ ed over a decade .
around 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Khr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , symbo@@ lic@@ ally represent the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ elled and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ endor @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ u@@ sche@@ v &apos;s , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ho@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children instead .

when holidays are , we are visiting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .

G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist in Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her home for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all of them lived just like they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy passes by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they walk , some of them throw stones on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ compl@@ ement@@ arity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and will be published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nonetheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about 2,50 dollar the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel . nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full mini @-@ bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping outside on board .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys medication that they can &apos;t pay , she massages them with a bal@@ sam the feet worn out of the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ aches ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then pull nor@@ th@@ wards .
the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder for the construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he says sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they continue to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez may be very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their little house this winter .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 persons are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he has fled to people with his wife and three children , who wanted to get money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single one , offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family is still living and trying to decide where to take the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors the travellers need to consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she puts on a lot of photos in her album .
there are one of their daughter with African hair we@@ aving , who made her a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad@@ ly , as she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users of the European People &apos;s Party
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a cell phone alert indicating the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but K@@ Ã²@@ n@@ th@@ ed the authorities to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they installed the app .
in the announcement of the police , it was clear that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and the south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ or@@ ships and monitoring measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ dow@@ ns .
the Twitter Media Out@@ let Images from mainland China , which publishes c@@ ens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police officers checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately about whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they might be imprison@@ ed for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use equipment intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( O@@ CR ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which it emerg@@ es that the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all governmental branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the Cyber@@ security Office &apos;s instructions for the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police until August 1 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights and gives them pun@@ ishments for a whole number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series of &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one that hon@@ ours her name all honor .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality cat@@ ches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond drama , beautiful scenes and performers - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence even when the Earth shifts on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ff@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a magnificent image that filled my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an is beginning to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only cour@@ a@@ geous enough to cry out if we are not close . &quot;
his hate @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the same with his father . &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cursed layout is in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
after that again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated to me a bigger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one of the other prisoners and must immediately set me up without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in no of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers fa@@ ther@@ ly deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I stayed .
li@@ lies .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ori@@ ously refres@@ h themselves in the garden of my head .
from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror into person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th of the Qur &apos;@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their confes@@ sional black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye @-@ field of their view of the world .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he happens to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Ta@@ ge@@ thi@@ eves and protest against demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have become acc@@ ust@@ omed to not answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I had nothing to make this punishment .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cri@@ es were not enough for him yet , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator had been working as a g@@ arbage collectors or whether that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables inter@@ s@@ ecting each other in order to present a great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find a favour at all , which is why he attacked an electrically charged stick as the next one .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ sh@@ ole with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move you , you will be rel@@ oc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sh@@ utt@@ eth to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( for example : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , facing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning their well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sex@@ uality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ists .
with his music , which often deals with issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all of these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the dis@@ astro@@ us consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he appe@@ als against US foreign policy a special incl@@ ination .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; while he poured in water soluble Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the slu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cock@@ tails of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a j@@ ail in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - in order not to land in j@@ ail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the MEPs and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been canc@@ eled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m , which is ques@@ tioning the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to commit to intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflected an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b showed traditional sex organs to the body by taking off his vision of the fate of Arab women who had mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently clou@@ ded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should trust them .
in the past few years the number of &apos; hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to adequately support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on com@@ b@@ ating fire from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in@@ definitely in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not shy away from subjects that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , he considers his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sex@@ uality , freedom and expression , cannot separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was told politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ini . &quot;
in this song one verse often repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosex@@ uality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and les@@ bian people and that comments on gender equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jama@@ ican online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and c@@ ens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; it was uploaded on You@@ tube without any cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is publicly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosex@@ uals does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ as , a poet of the eighth century who still remains remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic po@@ ems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asked himself : if Abu Nu@@ i , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosex@@ uality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service commen@@ ced several former dep@@ uty members and members of the teacher association with the reason that they critic@@ ised social media comment@@ aries on the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bom@@ bs , cluster muni@@ tions , and democr@@ atis@@ ation of artificial nature . at least he hopes it .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ rior d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ lor@@ ries , drums and dancing came from Japan to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous people of the region to force the em@@ bank@@ ers to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
yet for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high truck was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

external appearance and personal care rarely were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can reproduce these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an education in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year Beg@@ inning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this community with love for the children .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write letters of love to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel exp@@ elled to accommodate aff@@ ection ?
the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga of the B@@ ogot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation did not get out of the head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ab@@ ev@@ eg@@ ung F@@ ARC ( German : Revolution@@ ary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
but in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ ill@@ as , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and were carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in B@@ ogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent response .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and B@@ ogot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the B@@ ogot@@ Ã¡ Foundation travel@@ ed to the camp to personally persu@@ ade the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had given the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the Cam@@ bus@@ ches ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters were living ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has written something so beautiful in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him very hard and sat down beside the th@@ row@@ er .
perhaps he was tired of the war , I was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices of Vo@@ ices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have come together to discuss a round of discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice on the part of the state was working on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the possibility to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more equ@@ itable in this country .
for a purpose of this magn@@ itude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
listening to these people who have never heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even had lear@@ nt even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can contribute something to us and give a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the example of Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ ano@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the website of OC Media .
homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you &apos;ve brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen learned about the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear of her life she moved to the USA last end .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was watching a few shopping bags from my car back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
then I heard one sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still prof@@ ess the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses have you been laid - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of an night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets at the top ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
it became too much for my mother and she put a rope around the neck .
lu@@ ck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something wrong .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering with me , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you were safe , just because you left the country ?
our people know what kind of hotel you are looking for . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with a camera , I actually work hard to look at the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male shape .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do to those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has imprison@@ ed in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that &apos;s what I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end they demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; by blood has experienced satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine told me that there weren &apos;t many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relations or who have been abandoned by their relatives , in order to put themselves under the court of Cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are recorded there , so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV , claim@@ ing they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone imprison@@ ed in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was in itself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why wouldn &apos;t it have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
in the end , Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but eventually brought us back to the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the law of the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria never bowed to my head .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ as ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they are funny about the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed that you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change .
those who had been laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily wor@@ sen@@ ing .
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
aside from that , I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea @-@ riffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I sli@@ pped away places of refuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to weld you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ ils on them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines , which , the Russi@@ ans , have whatever ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
you know , many think about trans @-@ identity to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August saw the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was transferred to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on @-@ site warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ rons who , due to the persecution by the Iranian government , were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a major part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little from that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s to re@@ direct the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen@@ ing the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought in the region , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi yo@@ ungst@@ ers increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ oper@@ atives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and graduated with a university degree of 45 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arab@@ s and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement submitted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be in general all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , despite the same formation , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women , on black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to keep silent .
but nevertheless everyone agre@@ es that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sex@@ u@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often are referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sphere and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of every skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in which the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , so@@ jour@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate and mar@@ gin@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings which also absorb through cultural appropri@@ ation our customs and customs so as to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender , because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them of the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of applying for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stu@@ b@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and set ourselves into spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we reg@@ ain ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither survived nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ dle Ag@@ ainst contamination : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travel@@ ed in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern from Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med , fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a resident documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by means of structural engineering .
most of the names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena was showing abuse because of mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not profit anything .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are allowed to report at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ uses and a legal system that does not accommodate 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty realization pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads came to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police were recru@@ ited by women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women were also recru@@ ited here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who ref@@ unds in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own crime , law enforcement authorities cannot reasonably document how many women are murdered by their current or ex partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without complic@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Photo of Jes@@ sie Ins@@ fr@@ an PÃ©@@ rez . use with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that has nothing to do
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this was supposed to regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she had the psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I was a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , not native to Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner failed them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
after all , her weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non Initi@@ atives ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that F@@ em@@ izi@@ d is to explain to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the text was changed in some points in order to win members for the law that feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which must be borne by the victims of violence by themselves , if they simply want to permit display and maintain a secure lodging option to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse as part of inter @-@ human relations is seen .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer considered normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rat@@ ors get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must refund as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence have called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by means of structural engineering .
most of the names have been changed to protect the affected people .
independent media in Oman still exposed to attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be imprison@@ ed , where he served a year of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were arrested and tried in court , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having separated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only sult@@ an , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to limit , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ timi@@ date human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdi@@ ct in a succession dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS accepted the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper was prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial before the Court of M@@ ask@@ at took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 botanical ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 U.S. dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material which could pose a threat to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ anic re@@ als ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after completing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottoman government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister appointed once again the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the continued closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j un@@ condi@@ tionally and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can un@@ hin@@ der their right human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of opinion and association , as well as the right to assemble , support and protect peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zam@@ bia , picture taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is seldom or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research conducted by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zam@@ bia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious implications for national health .
he left Zam@@ bia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he even resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Zam@@ bian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently star@@ ing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
GV : what do you think is the key current scientific topics in your country and in Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no fundamental research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always be recipi@@ ents instead of being mach@@ o themselves .
the solutions we get are often not well use@@ able in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there &apos;s interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been growing let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ line Ne@@ edy , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents run not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card types . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer , since his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oulder is lying around which I have to yo@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new variety of let@@ tu@@ ce because all features are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as much as possible and tries to breed the features he wants .
however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red Roman salad at the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; plant in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station and where it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds as if the movement origin@@ ates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the free Open Source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant bre@@ eders are permanently har@@ n@@ essed .
as part of the initiative called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they cannot continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy their seed to breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately issue them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agr@@ arian industry , whose latest examples are being offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty is not possible without the sovereignty of the seed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed as the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is therefore always limited , shr@@ inks without ce@@ asing .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or carr@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted tra@@ its - from such , through which their taste or colour improves , through which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decre@@ asing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more urgent than ever before , as the changed conditions by climate change are much worse pre@@ dict@@ ably .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property en@@ closes other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not promoting innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to be able to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make work easier for farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed masses of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly the opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but are smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I &apos;m concerned with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected against competition for 20 years , making it pretty simple in my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the centre with farmers co@@ operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
it also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , for which the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled for next year should be the official starting signal .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a relationship that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how it is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we are trying to make people clear that even more are behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ DR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
August published the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it strongly cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information , despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ DR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to yield to it . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network from Qatar due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web page barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ DR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of articles and articles that he writes for sites and media that are not available in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s app@@ liance , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider on which there is also the blog , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blo@@ c of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a state of si@@ ege ; a arrest , attempted murder , loading at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website I was working for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , alb@@ eit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ ft ) , Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
A@@ le also documented the block@@ age of providers by enabling internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
A@@ ces reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the c@@ ens@@ or decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis with which they can act against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ ers sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens by the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that does not recognise war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper states that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , 8@@ 43 fields exist that are controlled by criminal organizations .
the newspaper writes in the editorial article :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oliv@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence is called &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent negl@@ ect of the public ministry .
reminder : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Jan@@ eiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to statistics of 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the company Glob@@ o , South America &apos;s largest media company , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia points out , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit created by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ed a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP became increasingly under fire after several reports on ch@@ ic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux rec@@ ited from one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also causes serious consequences for the human being .
for this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; er@@ ron@@ eous spheres . &quot;
war going back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas will continue to suffer in Rio .
one week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tist died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization of PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these re@@ bel controlled areas have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , which led to the need for local residents to rely on locally produced food or tunn@@ els and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a life @-@ saving food source .
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it will now gain more and more awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge to reproduce mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity of 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ ages , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the regions before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the propag@@ ation of fung@@ us for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee beans , carton , etc ) to produce new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Eli@@ as A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capit@@ als in Portugal on October 21 and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that spent the week in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by fires .
according to the European for@@ estry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread across the network and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Federal Government of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they didn &apos;t do so : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the Wal@@ let form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; added Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light fire@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread according to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups had broken out , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly un@@ protected .
the T@@ ali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the T@@ ali@@ ban , came ever near@@ er .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af met in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his minor reward , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged bags with mort@@ ars which were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his li@@ vel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not fre@@ eze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day .
true , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of admir@@ ation . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an asylum application - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unt@@ amed li@@ vel@@ ihood helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ lim@@ b .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 people live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the road to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years some Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country that he had to rely on as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their crop sho@@ ots on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of their full legal resolution on the authority &apos;s website , speci@@ fying their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or a penalty of pen@@ alties .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislation and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another MP filed a proposal to introduce tough@@ er pun@@ ishments for the offensive of the President or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law of the law , the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy would , however , be pun@@ ish@@ able under the law proposal .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstr@@ ating violence against the military coup that led to the arrest of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed because the prison leadership failed in accordance with human rights groups to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the apparent load of others arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the sentences of the journalist Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating Tun@@ isian activists to in@@ feed documents
in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated with a continuous action plan . according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia was specifically supported by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supported a controversial bill of law by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , accused of guarant@@ e@@ eing all un@@ lawful kill@@ ings .
the document published on the 21st of April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how the presidential plans look to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the nam@@ ing of its sources , indicating Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
in spite of that , he was a witness in the case of the District Court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to the new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China information offices , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
the regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts assume that in this way , the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is up to now uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to implement these regulations only sel@@ ectively to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the local government as the &quot; organiz@@ er of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to termin@@ ate user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court has Sper@@ m Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups in order to make a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website , including China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .

after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor real @-@ time communications and install CIA programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ation companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
