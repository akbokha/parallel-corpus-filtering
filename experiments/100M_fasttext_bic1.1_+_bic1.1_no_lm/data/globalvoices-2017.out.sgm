<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "me it was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shameful love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, expressing his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trumps" "" "" "" "does not agree with the" "" "" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "" "" "" "by Peter Bhatia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fought the environment for their lives, and their husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still suits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Paney, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump launched its way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is hard to forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man looking down contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (note d.): as much as "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities"; pun from white in allusion to the white and whiplash, which means as much as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise, saying: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "" "" "No!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices grew louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "could someone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music with garbage</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero in the Oaxaca province share with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212, an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest of the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located on top of the largest landfill of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers led by Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all from garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article published by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and teacher of the children of Cateura, commemorates the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of recycled material that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic MÃ¼llerponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project to fight wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated underground fishing in Liberia's waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to visit one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "Benedict Kiilu is a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"that's why we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate violation of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing have once been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the Schneckentempo, which circulated information between individual countries, the actions nowadays happen in real time, with trackable on a FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. even suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship is transporting its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports based on this information. meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "" "" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "" "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm advocating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform already mentioned was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, losing eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, fantasies of fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation," "" "" "" "says Long." "" "" "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" You cannot run my harbor. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Comm to me." "and exactly this legal loophole attempt to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It discovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international association for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers a technical support to FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i should help to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can the FISH-i's team actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed world-wide by the position of each tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what" "" "" "", "he says." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run where a global system allows the pursuit of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect crimes, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fake without licence and hardly expected consequences know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have reached a 33% increase in Fisheries, since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia, the inspectors were there on board towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "We have become an object of study." "" "" "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually pass through illegal fishing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a vessel that was flying under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without licence and were used towing nets which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fisherman from Somalia. "" with the taking of measures against Grey1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea.

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the discharge of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness, when they assembled themselves on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the backyard of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes-regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation worsens continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the discharge of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro; in the end, however, the holding of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence belong to the highest all over the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine, the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called for a large majority of opposition representatives after the 2015 elections, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, planned to continue blocking the referendum on the term of office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is far Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images which relate to disputes, as well as reports of oppression and maltreatment are accumulating on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves beat the message of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira have no skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic already makes the round, which covers the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an administrative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now declared his father in the context of the great La Perla Ribera Process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis did not have a choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a policeman. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service department in La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijenko's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who said before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Don't forget that they don't kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolutionucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military, I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">The prisoners are tortured "</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it I saw that there was a big lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch that men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They unleashed a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it out with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>

<seg id="329">In Spanish, the term "megacausa" refers to the magnitude of the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="330">After four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historic La Perla-Ribera was ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 716 victims eventually in August.</seg>
<seg id="331">43 oppressors were found guilty of crimes against humanity. in 28 cases the Court sentenced life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years. in six cases, there were acquittals.</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was circulated in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of Joshua Levine's original photos.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre where you can extend your driving license last month are witnesses to a particularly miserable translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield the Japanese word used to be the "old motorists" (koreibelowa), which means "older motorists," falsely - but perhaps also with evil hind thoughts and # 8212; translated as a "terrible car driver."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "Holmes said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) of our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News diverted somewhat more extensively with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country are worried.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors, representing a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents altogether.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The name unnamed reporter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo, showing what prejudices some Japanese seem to heap against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation error has among others the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "-" Is this ("" "" "" "" terrible car driver ") not reality?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are multifaceted.</seg>
<seg id="377">To override, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and proactive language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speaker, for example, should translate from English into French - not French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native speakers who could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can nevertheless make translations in the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic phrases produced by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling printouts that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: take protests and break-ups on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups that oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenorship: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites are again locked by Venezuelan Internet providers.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a "call to force."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the Internet site at which the National Assembly transfers its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds erroneous or refuses to request the request of such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who took the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been reported to regulate Internet connections, making access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today, Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness statements of other Criaditas, which became exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a report of structural, which is published by Global Voices, courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), which is edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house once more and heard the owner of the house with pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas one calls in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to spend countless day housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criminacgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous discomforts of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organisation fighting for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criminazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated by the Criaditas guarantees in general not to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criminazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is abused, his family will experience it for many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in secrecy in Paraguayan households has got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n arrived at CaaguazÃº in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of heavy blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military associate TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">End of January 2016 Ferreira ended up with a stick on MarÃ­n until she suffered a fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a crib.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criminazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest conferences and called for "no further Carolina" to be present in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to offend the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her crib.</seg>

<seg id="454">The daily life of a crib</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling candy on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as a crib.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's home, Alvarenga worked for four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisists of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read leading articles from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">While he was intelligent, he did not entertain her. "the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they often didn't allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would learn" bad habits "again." they said that Alvarenga, who is part of GuaranÃ­'s indigenous group, would again speak their mother tongue GuaranÃ­ back home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had made for her.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the chicans who are exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a crib.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a cash buck.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft bill consisting of six paragraphs and censored in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration on them. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the animal conservationist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of the leopards, which runs through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza enjoys a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School at Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017 documented the progress made for the northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was a great prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring fectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced into force because the tsunami had destroyed entire coastal towns on the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture did not yet experience an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacements (including the Humphima, Miyagi and Iwate) prefectures were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was achieved by Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned spare-houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the disaster, the evacuation of barren accommodation (the leading of the United States of the United States of Kazakhstan jute acu) is still to be relocated to final replacements.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima Evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful at this stage. more than 75 percent of evacuation homes culminated in homes after disaster were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate this figure is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune had opened their doors up to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the ports in Fukushima resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been largely affected by the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, where only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland can be re-used in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the nuclear sheltered zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here, Fukushima remains far abrupt.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers find it harder to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feel has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has raised its attention to the situation of the Fukushima evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was witnessed by the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">Since 2017, there are still some 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation circuits are older than 50 years old. it is well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student aged 33 years old was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer during a demonstration in Goidea hit him with a striking stick against his head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred it to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos from the attack on Mateus, who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended from the active service until the final examination of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes at Goidea with his striking stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer could be beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel by media activists from Goidea, shared the video taken by Luiz da Luz in the network, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks shortly afterwards hurry to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in a different state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goirannia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he sabotaged the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here we have sabotaged a busy school with a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a striking stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police raid over</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers staged protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators built a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against protesters via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on a different, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo admired specifically about a broken glass window to depict their titles as illustrative with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus caught fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">You also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate significance, and the typical violence of the military police is concealed by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontational discourse with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Ãlvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba opened doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich Municipality, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter of fact that there is no appreciable sugar crop on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete rumour remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute every day to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long period of inactive time are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resists plagues, socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all interviewees are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of exile, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recorded documents which differed only with respect to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulisse Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, with Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important job vacancies has been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the systems in the communities in which they were present were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the folk community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory concluded, or rather, when they began to unmask it, they also stopped to asphale the road, which also disadvantaged other companies.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to visit other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without prospects for the future, many young people left the region at once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the care of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been offering mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and collaborated in North Quebec with ten Cree Communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop calls for the young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called the Highway of Tears, a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters did not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following hymn that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, giving them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what it has intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also make a contribution and add the verse in syllable script (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed in the vicinity of the Shokuhin sanpuru (all of the way), "" "" "" "" sculptural models of dishes "" "" "" "" of any food that is served in this restaurant. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo-Ga.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. a new trend, however, is turning it into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Shokuhin sangelu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special selling: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic panes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin's fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming more and more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there someone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form so as to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mellow ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand bands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic dishes can be viewed under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter follow the hashtag # of all the "" "" "" "" s "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and murdered regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, head of the Sinaloa Kartell, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolyÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal polÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidy que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Changed Life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez who lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priests: "like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves, to go and search for tombs, according to the people we loved."</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of offenders when walking through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by" "" "" "" "being resident." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months exhaustion in the capital district": how a family was sacked with threats. "in this she describes how armed criminals squeezed money out of her business month by month until they had destroyed their family apart in the end.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything that you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the article" "" "" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, make potatoes, keep tortillas warm and make "Chicco" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood was ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Civil Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 mords per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolyÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country during the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to make tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the site Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the Civil War, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">The official representatives described a fireball, which covered dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people looking at the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated for unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of reduced bodies which are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been viewed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one left to count bodies," "" "" "" "said a Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were smashed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted figuratively on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win Land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from DR Congo as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of miswrite-ups; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments like this example falsely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The drawing from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flashpoint, published by the United Nations, those who were able to escape strokes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya, posts appeared like the following that brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page falsely claiming that the President Myanmars Thein said that monks and politicians have participated in the killing of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to view this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on April 26, 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations that called AFP as their source also falsely attributed to Thein being this statement, but had not associated the image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false decoupling reach back into the years of 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse image search" you can see how far information can pass boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed-mask private pages, social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed on false reports, some have tried to expose the falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have bordered examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published. thus, we want to illustrate the reach more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of abusive use may originate from the countries listed below (which have also been interconnected in some cases).</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of mis- and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers, and they have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be detached from the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false representations should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photographer Andy Simmons uses the CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name of untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saucers) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand precisely what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Mwabol language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Get your parents in recognition of how you have endeavoured in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page and want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Orators of Treasure Languages, highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, Founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland, the United States, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, is the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong to." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while" "" "" "" "listening often is linked to understanding" "" "" "" "these events instead" "" "" "" "listen to appreciate, to feel," "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format story-narrator put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and depiction lead to the recognition of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidator Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboat in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march started at the Puertorium Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church council Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demanded that the politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we call for financial audits and a Steering Committee without personal interests to public debt, with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books made by so-called 'Book Sprints' produced within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective postresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for sharing knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison where he was lodged on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police had taken a Bassel on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who took notice of themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything under it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysrien but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This campaign in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be of invaluable importance for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyesight,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment when we embrace</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: allegations of corruption convicted director after release on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half his sentence, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants due to impurities of 54 million Metikal.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose council presented Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no grounds for Cambaza to regain his old post, as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integration dade PÃºblica, shortly CIP) condemned the decision of the company to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was apparently silent and did not take reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been demolished.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is imprisoned:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are imprisoned in the prison of Samora Machel, will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mosambians, but also as a sharp, dashing and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he strongly affirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not like that. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "" "" "an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">The reactions were negative in Twitter:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "the" trafficker "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts discussing the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spectbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook had to be analytic before deleting all posts suspected of disseminating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on FaceBook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (Chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared the opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and prohibited such words as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks auto censorship provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and don't consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate language but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than censing the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at it better in context than on code-concentrating initiatives and learnt from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The toddlers are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the old age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016 there was a large public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), assembled the representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not interfere since that, "age does not determine the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contract partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, which defines minors as "anyone under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who have already been married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago, was 2.8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavored to abolish laws on the toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">But not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition arose for tension in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill altogether.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who was enthralled, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law declare." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws on the toe were finally amended.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that disguises the core of the matter, but know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was of opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status-Update on Facebook by Lara Quentral - Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">The Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all deputies who were opposed have agreed to the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The toddlers in Trinidad and Tobago are not allowed by law any more.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) Carrier Revival.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj pleaded his intention to take legal action, and the law was to be passed, and he seems to have fulfilled his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi was a proponent of the law, it was quite rightful if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wish that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that the state, which protects our daughters from being abused by large, stubborn men who are in the advantage to them, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in various grades, although there are laws that forbid them.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers lead the office of the prosecutor to nationwide protests on the Russian national holiday</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message posted on Sunday morning on the website of the prosecutor of Yaroslavl district.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coincided with Russia's Day - Russian National Day, the Prosecutor's website was hacked by YAroslavl district. hackers left a witty message "staying at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Or we'll bring you to the toast instead of Dimon. "</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes more clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and TV series fans defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform stopped all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralised peer-to-peer network, which is not based on domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli by Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar MirrorPages when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and employee at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlting rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the river Rapti.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crap pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood face to face to Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the bush suddenly appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares at the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for pillar" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of their social pressure they should respect the husband as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a pseudo-court from the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name, too, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walsh in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals as well as housewives, presented a unique club and were thus quickly become the main topic of conversation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the delicacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the degradation of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to discover practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion rounds was of women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying aloud to the names of their husbands is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as being left behind, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name, wanted to try out at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they spoke about their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a century-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she could only giggle over the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustrations against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on behalf of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in his head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead that shows the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the intoxicated point if he would also do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunches and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry who could hear what they could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline courta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the merits of its own dress code, morality connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the assurance that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we're talking about and what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a reversal in the Japanese culture of post-war period.</seg>

<seg id="1554">Many well known Japanese sizes achieved its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping bald persons for organ retail, presumably for superstitious purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the Milange district, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia found the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murder for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country carried out a mission to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who were going to go to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are aiming for ritual attacks, the mosque police warned of the latest assassination of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the Milange district, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morblabala, province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this also attract the police of the Republic of Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blog medium Armen Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I LOVE RIDERN A mosque that the people would have shame on going on the street, dressed as if they would be ashamed of the recordings of a pornofilm in which the teachers would indulge in good marks, and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the albinos nor bald ones are hunted for superstitious purposes or "black magic" that aim to attain fast riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, Human Rights Watch Scientist for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the leader of the Morrumbala district, Pedro Sapange, and the police spokesperson ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both bald-headed:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for live cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (National endangerment), after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "" "" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "" "" "an internal matter" "" "" "" "and a spokesman says he considers it" "" "" "" "not required to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to release calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Liu's case.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian Government concluded that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to restart the Salmon on China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top sealings of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she stated in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They shall meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad shared with the fact that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US embassy moved into an angry response from China to itself, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to intervene in a single and irresponsible comment on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Switzerland, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hopes that Liu "gets all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu might overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer declared AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of speech and freedom of incorporation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where,. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France would eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan City of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on June 27 and to show greater tolerance to those who advocate peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with a statement on June 28 around Liu and indicated that many have asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 which stand for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1685">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmule, Singapore should be considered a city." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the domination of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "twist the logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmule were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other "normal countries," in the face of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, forsaken the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmucus were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He would disguise such questions with non-answers of rational forms.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmule to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our ad K Shanmule would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that it was paid up in order to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">While Anon has published his comments on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmucus's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said Singapore" "" "" "" "be no country," "" "" "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmucus, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Singapore's Minister of Justice said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmule, a member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements by Mr. Shanmucus are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumours covering certain parts of the world and presenting another facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "" "" "the question that is most asked for me in Japan is:" "" "" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I'm from Canada." I have been living in Japan since 1994.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inside anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, being called "nice" means to be fun - just like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (who has a Canadian double DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can bump.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Thankfully for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodizing Thailand's junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop-band, famous in Thailand, released a music video that decodes the junta who took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what precepts he makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video indirectly refers to the ongoing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the videos that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program for "setting up" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime whose vague and unclear precepts are often exploited by the authorities to arrest arrests and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unity was set up in the army, which monitors and prosecutes the online content and persons, accused of being expelled from the monarchy, prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict fight against "Lese Majeste" (majesty's insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, war law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continue to pursue is buying expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payables.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1803">The following article, written by Dmitri Stateynov, was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The post-war society is recovered only very slowly in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">More than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchasan war has been officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district of Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhangokha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal-dock of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Amorgos, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these clerks.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of the Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district accounted for 16,000 people, having hardly climbed over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Around 43,000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-storey living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60's, called Khrushchchkovkas, symbolically represent the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1828">Before the war, the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centres, schools and kindergartens that served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded splendor-buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">About fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of Dzhantukha.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khruschev's, which still house one or two families, can be seen on the balconies, where linen is dried.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nonetheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollar the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel. nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, people come in full mini-busses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping outside on board.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys medication that they can't pay, she massages them with a balsam the feet worn out of the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtaches) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he responds with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then pull northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that the Africans are already talking about Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder for the construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he says smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send text messages when they continue to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez may be very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family welcomed migrants in their little house this winter.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 persons are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that in Honduras he has fled to people with his wife and three children, who wanted to get money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single one, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family is still living and trying to decide where to take the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors the travellers need to consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she puts on a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of their daughter with African hair weaving, who made her a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she briefly introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron" repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users of the European People's Party</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi have received a cell phone alert indicating the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the announcement it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevent" "" "" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But KÃ²nthed the authorities to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, it was clear that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and the south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censorships and monitoring measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter Media Outlet Images from mainland China, which publishes censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers checked the residents indiscriminately about whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use equipment intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (OCR) also published a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the Cybersecurity Office's instructions for the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates Urumquis's personality rights and gives them punishments for a whole number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in no of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be seen on me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all only numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers fatherly deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would leave him if I stayed.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Lilies.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have a scarecrow to drive away all these crows, which laboriously refresh themselves in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From afar, I still hear them cry "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries are ringing, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the color of calamity until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror into person: the Raad (about: "thunder," allusion to 13th of the Qur'an).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are here to be heard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was vented: to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betrayer and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the close eye-field of their view of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house that is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I enter the listening room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he happens to me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that derail him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Tagethieves and protest against demonstrations that will soon end up."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have become accustomed to not answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I had nothing to make this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure with him, and you cannot withhold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not enough for him yet, why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had been working as a garbage collectors or whether that belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables intersecting each other in order to present a great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and did not find a favour at all, which is why he attacked an electrically charged stick as the next one.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which occurred to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "" "" "" "asshole with you, asshole." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "" "" "I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "" "" "" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "be quiet and move you, you will be relocated." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always had let me free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shutteth to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyees (for example: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, facing the conservative majority and questioning their well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapists.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all of these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he appeals against US foreign policy a special inclination.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees from the second generation," he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a person," while he poured in water soluble NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slugs speak lukewarm coffee and the cocktails of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a jail in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the MEPs and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert "just" had been canceled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which is questioning the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to commit to intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflected an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib showed traditional sex organs to the body by taking off his vision of the fate of Arab women who had marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently clouded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of 'honorary murders' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to adequately support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on combating fire from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held indefinitely in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not shy away from subjects that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, he considers his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was told politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santorini."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse often repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is also." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what one wants" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and lesbian people and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jamaican online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"it was uploaded on Youtube without any cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is publicly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuas, a poet of the eighth century who still remains remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asked himself: if Abu Nui, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service commenced several former deputy members and members of the teacher association with the reason that they criticised social media commentaries on the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and democratisation of artificial nature. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forlorries, drums and dancing came from Japan to the Northeast to force the indigenous people of the region to force the embankers to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>

<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and personal care rarely were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an education in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "" "" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write letters of love to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation did not get out of the head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerrillabevegung FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotÃ¡ Foundation traveled to the camp to personally persuade the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had given the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the Cambusches (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters were living) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I said to him," "" "" "" "Hello, what do you do?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no one has written something so beautiful in my life, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very hard and sat down beside the thrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, I was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices of Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC have come together to discuss a round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state was working on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the possibility to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more equitable in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Listening to these people who have never heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even had learnt even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can contribute something to us and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monanove, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified.</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2249">"you've brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Tschetschenen learned about the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear of her life she moved to the USA last end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was watching a few shopping bags from my car back seat, I heard a male voice saying, "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard one sentence, but this time on Chechnya: "how long will you still profess the family, you Schandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses have you been laid - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets at the top; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "You brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family, but the entire Republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and she put a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering with me, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you were safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know what kind of hotel you are looking for. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender balance, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I actually work hard to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do to those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That's what I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end they demand proof that the so-called "honor" by blood has experienced satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine told me that there weren't many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relations or who have been abandoned by their relatives, in order to put themselves under the court of Cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there, so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say," "" "" "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV, claiming they had attacked any village or military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was in itself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why wouldn't it have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already familiar with Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In the end, Russia wanted to introduce us to "civilisation," but eventually brought us back to the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the law of the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia never bowed to my head.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharas ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they are funny about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed that you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stepped on to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had been laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Aside from that, I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea-riffs, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I slipped away places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to weld you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no boils on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the Kabardines, which, the Russians, have whatever; on the whole planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about trans-identity to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to pay the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was transferred to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on-site warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patrons who, due to the persecution by the Iranian government, were helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a major part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams to redirect the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsening the devastation caused by drought in the region, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and graduated with a university degree of 45%.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "" "" "a" systematic strategy "" "" "" "..." aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">As functionaries and institutions do not prefers to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and so hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement submitted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well-thought out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be in general all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same formation, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women, on black women in LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often are referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphere and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of every skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "in 1851, sojourner said:" "" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a disproportionate and marginalized." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings which also absorb through cultural appropriation our customs and customs so as to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender, because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them of the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of the Womanism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of applying for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and set ourselves into spheres that are created by us for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: laiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we regain ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has neither survived nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most of the names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife of Balbuena was showing abuse because of maltreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez did not profit anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are allowed to report at all, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content1 punches and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatuses and a legal system that does not accommodate 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, faulty realization punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports which do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads came to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police were recruited by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women were also recruited here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who refunds in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "two women who do not do this," "" "" "" "said at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own crime, law enforcement authorities cannot reasonably document how many women are murdered by their current or ex partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that has nothing to do</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then she gave up. this was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she had the psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I was a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, not native to Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner failed them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others don't do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">After all, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # Porelas (# fÃ¼rst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non Initiatives) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that Femizid is to explain to an independent criminal record and to punish harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the text was changed in some points in order to win members for the law that feared that the road to decriminalisation of abortions, currently prohibited in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which must be borne by the victims of violence by themselves, if they simply want to permit display and maintain a secure lodging option to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse as part of inter-human relations is seen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must refund as long as abuse is no longer considered normal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been altered, among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence have called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman still exposed to attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information" "" "" "" "on the website of the forbidden newspaper Azamn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for their reporting on corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be imprisoned, where he served a year of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were arrested and tried in court, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having separated his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only sultan, he has been suffering the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, public liberties, including freedom of the press, to limit, intimidate and intimidate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces captured Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, after an article published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary." this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a succession dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS accepted the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj who acted as Chief Editor for Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper was prohibited on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial before the Court of Maskat took place in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, inter alia, for a disturbance of the public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 botanical rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 U.S. dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of "an information network for the dissemination of material which could pose a threat to the public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit amounting to 5000 omanic reals (13 000 US dollars) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after completing his six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottoman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the Minister appointed once again the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continued closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Iranian authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj unconditionally and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances, to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can unhinder their right human rights work without fear of retaliation, including judicial chicans.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) is an independent, non-profit and non-governmental organization that supports human rights defenders (including independent journalists, bloggers, lawyers etc.) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of opinion and association, as well as the right to assemble, support and protect peacefully.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research conducted by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he even researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Zambian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently staring a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the key current scientific topics in your country and in Africa in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no fundamental research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being macho themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well useable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there's interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been growing lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outline Needy, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents run not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card types. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer, since his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to yodel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new variety of lettuce because all features are already patented. "he continues to do as much as possible and tries to breed the features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red Roman salad at the "glasshouse" plant in the "glasshouse" of the station and where it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the free Open Source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant breeders are permanently harnessed.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they cannot continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seed to breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately issue them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," says he and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agrarian industry, whose latest examples are being offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty is not possible without the sovereignty of the seed." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized as the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is therefore always limited, shrinks without ceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves, through which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more urgent than ever before, as the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predictably.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property encloses other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly not promoting innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to be able to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want to make work easier for farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we don't really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed masses of herbicides, breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly the opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets but are smaller than e.g. Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I'm concerned with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected against competition for 20 years, making it pretty simple in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leading in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. the centre with farmers cooperates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from country to country, for which the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled for next year should be the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report published by aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy, thereby ensuring a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a relationship that Luby of OSSI hopes to see more people soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how it is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," said Luby. "" "" "" "" now we are trying to make people clear that even more are behind their food. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANDRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published the network an opinion on Facebook, in which it strongly criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information, despite this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities, to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, has never been as important as it is now. ANDRI confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to yield to it. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web page barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANDRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer exists in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles that he writes for sites and media that are not available in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's appliance, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider on which there is also the blog, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the bloc of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; a arrest, attempted murder, loading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Aft), Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Ale also documented the blockage of providers by enabling internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Aces reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censor decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis with which they can act against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves rob the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timers sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air wafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra" published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens by the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that does not recognise war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper states that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 fields exist that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The newspaper writes in the editorial article:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than they use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing that violence is called "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "" "" "according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "" "" "according to statistics of 2015, 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "when we look at the murders per state, Rio is on No. 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to the company Globo, South America's largest media company, which, as CecÃ­lia points out, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit created by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer a Favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationed a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP became increasingly under fire after several reports on chicanes and repressions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux recited from one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also causes serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "erroneous spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War going back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas will continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho, to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orthodontist died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2800">Screenshot from the advertising video.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Source: CanDoAction</seg>
<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, chiefly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization of PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly severely affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the need for local residents to rely on locally produced food or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a life-saving food source.</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge to reproduce mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around â¬12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity of 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capitals in Portugal on October 21 and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that spent the week in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the Federal Government of Portugal stated the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they didn't do so: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "" "" "in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the Wallet form, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," added JoÃ£o Sorval in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light fireable wood, as in a vicious circle, continue to spread according to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was crucial at this fateful weekend in October so that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war between the various Mujahedin groups had broken out, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of the Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning the boy was supposed to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt suddenly unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Taliban, came ever nearer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf met in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his minor reward, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged bags with mortars which were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">True, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high levels of admiration. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an asylum application - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed livelihood helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast-limb.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, some 20,000 people live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghans have been created, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country that he had to rely on as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "they can sell their crop shoots on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this road.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot demonstrating challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill which stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of their full legal resolution on the authority's website, specifying their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or a penalty of penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislation and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in May another MP filed a proposal to introduce tougher punishments for the offensive of the President or a high officials." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law of the law, the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy would, however, be punishable under the law proposal.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against the military coup that led to the arrest of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison on a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed because the prison leadership failed in accordance with human rights groups to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, the apparent load of others arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-barbary. they were charged with their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentences of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to infeed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated with a continuous action plan. according to the plan, Ben Gharbia was specifically supported by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supported a controversial bill of law by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, accused of guaranteeing all unlawful killings.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the 21st of April on the website of Nawaat casts a light on how the presidential plans look to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejects the naming of its sources, indicating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of that, he was a witness in the case of the District Court in Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the People's Republic of China information offices, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that in this way, the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to implement these regulations only selectively to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roscomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the local government as the "organizer of the dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information. the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to terminate user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish Court has Sperm Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias locking in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it was "an information source that cooperates with groups in order to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website, including China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop snuffling</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor real-time communications and install CIA programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunication companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
