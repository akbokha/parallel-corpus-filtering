this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally stopped phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb to Iran .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter altogether ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has determined against cra@@ cks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to j@@ ail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they were told for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government on cra@@ cks were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can be hidden more and less .
instead of separ@@ ating and removing cra@@ cks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his teleph@@ ones secret ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his loan agreement , and even travel wise with the list of flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ ck of alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all the governments of the United States in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put on the press work to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to pick out all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology has allowed the government to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in witness stand .
today there is communication software , which still did not exist as cra@@ cks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet reputation , the Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which we received , and is now developed further by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government cannot get information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the ou@@ tset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole , in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bear mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who beats the alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest database of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has letter boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agent laun@@ cher or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , to me , to ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and conc@@ eal their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presum@@ ably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who were in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a database of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is true that in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off scho@@ ol@@ children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed to rip especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shock@@ ed us that everyone except a lawyer asked our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given any money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability to be established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behaviour .
this may sound very melanch@@ ol@@ y as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have begun to change .
in the past few years we have seen proj@@ ections towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA lag@@ s behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lamps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this type of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a res@@ ale sales .
a guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace song , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kid@@ n@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wa@@ it as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the blank@@ et and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I see there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on to@@ e pointed to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into a lot of fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to do . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wood floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes swe@@ pt completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
had we discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private spaces , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwell@@ ings of other people .
why ?
because as children , we have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you think about the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your relaxed phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this silent p@@ low of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
most of the guests feel that they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gore &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please proc@@ laim on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ ly candidate for the office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had imag@@ ined with his name ? if he had told him where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well sprung mobiles ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their ass@@ essments before we posted them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation suff@@ oc@@ ates common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I do holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we had@@ n &apos;t counted was the large amount of people who were more than willing to disp@@ ose of these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had previously not been covered .
for us , business is just going very well .
of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly .
there were guests who had not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , only one fraction of the 123 million ac@@ comod@@ ated nights had a problem .
for men ri@@ ghtly trust each other .
when trust works , you can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his judgment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attack due to seated activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real guar@@ dian angels that save one &apos;s life even though they don &apos;t know yet .
you go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people share a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet made of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l quarter of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could cook cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities were to take on the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were pulled out . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t rein@@ vent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why exactly our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with whi@@ pped cream .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure that I was 17 year old felt to fit me with a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents passi@@ vely .
I have strug@@ gl@@ ed with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read him , thought , ques@@ tioned , dou@@ b@@ ted , and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened in every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock was quickly turned into rebel@@ lion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim Terr@@ orists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me into a susp@@ ect .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I feared the first time I was to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city in which it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , and I saw the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not attend to you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , torn apart and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have rep@@ elled the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be some parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant views of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts of extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or apost@@ ate .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations , when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m returned to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que guard her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , there are at least three things happening .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather backed military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two poll@@ ing periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terrorism as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow out the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective debt it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his res@@ ume . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about which America would leave us to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall , and what I saw left me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be sure ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker &apos;s thin@@ ker working in a noble thought factory , so an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking for Muslims around the world and I did it with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want welfare for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ ary business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et delivery entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ gate ,
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter in which position the flight device is able to reg@@ ain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that come to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts : a propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mono @-@ winner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ sters , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right when I watch all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night .
when the mon@@ osp@@ a is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is quite symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus it receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us look at that .
once flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers air@@ planes .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the others counter clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when they build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly , if restricted too .
we will demonstrate this by doing half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway a particularly safe machine would like to be a flying shade @-@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed together in a very far distant galax@@ y , and so the mass of three s@@ uns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us prescri@@ be the events at first for a period of time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of especially Mu@@ eller -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Book of Gravit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , lig@@ o was launched for a last test run in order to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes penet@@ rated through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector through .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well to my sick father .
in essence , this was the fruit of my life &apos;s work .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their by observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
for illustration , instruc@@ tors in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead a really liberal dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and du@@ ck . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and pl@@ ung@@ ed when the waves were hit . the stretch of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . that &apos;s why the lig@@ o employees were driving for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and certainly all obstacles will be overcome with the support of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite handy , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now just Alice talks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range for lig@@ o .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to the universe .
listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one h@@ ears the same pair of p@@ ens with an additional key change . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of vocabulary , engraved in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear does recognize this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times each sun , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , circle one hundred times a second before col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens up an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them all over the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as they are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , lig@@ o found things that we did not expect from the first attempt .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as lig@@ o they are watching , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the m@@ ess bones for our archaeological work so to speak .
lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build magnificent det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of .
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to live on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , my fear removed .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my smallest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; for un@@ explained reasons ,
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; I guess I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like you get to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode each nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , times four , 16 epis@@ odes at the same time : 24 epis@@ odes : grey &apos;s , 21 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the C@@ atch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run after one another on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country , or a class@@ room , take me seriously if I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just typ@@ ing on the computer and f@@ anta@@ si@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming of dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a portrait of a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the tot@@ als -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , that bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a h@@ um then you cannot strive for size differently .
the feeling not to be different than to asp@@ ire to size doesn &apos;t matter at what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of premature failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more exagger@@ ated boundaries , the more work there is , the more I am writing , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land that I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the h@@ um , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work of work .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ an .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums ceased .
the sum of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flag@@ ship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you work , you love what you do , a teacher , a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things will become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
she does not call anyone any more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and smo@@ other my sums , and here everything changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters play a lot , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ ner &quot; releases .
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy stroke is coming in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ is@@ um , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe my brain with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ em is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing doesn &apos;t seem to me like working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better working than being at home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we fly around in the garden , before and behind , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bu@@ bbles .
in doing so I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and talks to my teen@@ age daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only 15 minutes , more is not needed .
everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ rac@@ tion .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it &apos;s important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I leave and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is about everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the sum@@ ming seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bu@@ bbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the sum of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a journey to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like , I &apos;m w@@ aking you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; one impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in the skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is weak and the c@@ ran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist .
what do I mean by it ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families .
you have to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they part@@ ed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain stem cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is , however , clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them colour@@ fully to be able to keep track of them in the brain .
in the last step , we impl@@ anted it at the birth place of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are m@@ aturing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we are mat@@ ing the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already busy , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were m@@ asked .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in cultivation .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity job .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills range in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to some extent , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the mon@@ key had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells .
on the left , they see the mon@@ key that recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we m@@ asked the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after the m@@ aturing .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the major obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to get someone to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first of all , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ant@@ ed@@ ence .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is actually d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- might not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rising friends , who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group er@@ ect a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are united , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of wast@@ ing , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the weal@@ thy savers and corporations , who are too timi@@ d to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sound like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the US $ 5.1 tril@@ lion , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ame the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , like in an endless loop , strengthens the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , in fear , the prophecy of the ox could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally bring about the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
that is my v@@ ow with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons .
the crucial thing about the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two will take place by gradually under@@ mining policy and expos@@ ing it .
wonder why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which it nour@@ ishes , decim@@ ated that it star@@ ves at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so can@@ ni@@ fied politics itself , that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives out demo@@ s &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and social conflicts are deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long conversations with the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the company area : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income is derived from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; in the interest of all mankind .
keep in mind that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade defic@@ it or the surplus of the country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which they fav@@ ored privileged persons , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global , Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ anis ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ anis Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... if we do not , technological development will produce such a sharp decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transmitt@@ ing this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am completely confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : actually , and now we are probably .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , whereas the area where most ab@@ dic@@ tions - the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say it so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells ra@@ i@@ ously according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of the year six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting as we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
that is to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive rejection line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or minister , who claims to be in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions of the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders who imposed this policy on us stood : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not survi@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the free centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me it will be equally well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Y@@ anis , thank you for staying with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of her life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog @-@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , which shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where after you have looked up a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium term , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create achievements .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon has nothing to do for free , do you pick up properly ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , who record everything .
you can record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com on four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many can &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers what actors .
when they had all the parts together they embar@@ ked on a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com of four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic dict@@ ates somehow that this should work in all .
if you collect millions of dates for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company of Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dism@@ iss@@ al is made .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ ding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could forecast data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst way -- by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fla@@ w@@ lessly , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data is rapidly chann@@ eled into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the individual pieces together in order to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they vie for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will later f@@ atten it with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in retrosp@@ ect on the ball .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it is still paying out to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
