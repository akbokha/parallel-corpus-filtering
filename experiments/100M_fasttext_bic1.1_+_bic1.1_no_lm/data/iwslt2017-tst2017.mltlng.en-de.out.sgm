<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally stopped phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter altogether?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has determined against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, although they were told for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government on cracks were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can be hidden more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and removing cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephones secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his loan agreement, and even travel wise with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a whistleblower and crack of alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all the governments of the United States in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we put on the press work to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to pick out all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which still did not exist as cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet reputation, the Aaron Swartz, which we received, and is now developed further by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so the government cannot get information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole, in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators like Edward Snowden have a chance to bear misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer who beats the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest database of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money] have hidden in tax havens.] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and attorneys go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letter boxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent launcher or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, to me, to ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and conceal their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who were in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens operate, mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a database of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is true that in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed to rip especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer asked our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given any money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability to be established." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very melancholy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen projections towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need managers in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this type of transparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a resale sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace song, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard say:" "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Wait as please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what did I see there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on toe pointed to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something to do. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wood floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes swept completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and me stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwellings of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children, we have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you think about the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your relaxed phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent plow of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the guests feel that they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gore's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please proclaim on Twitter that he is candidly candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had imagined with his name? if he had told him where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold very well sprung mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their assessments before we posted them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation suffocates common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you talk too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- "" "" "" "" the request is not accepted. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "" "" "Great works of art in your home! I do holiday with my family." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we hadn't counted was the large amount of people who were more than willing to dispose of these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had previously not been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is just going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who had not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, only one fraction of the 123 million accomodated nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men rightly trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, you can create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attack due to seated activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save one's life even though they don't know yet.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but now it's just" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the thing is not fair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet made of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl quarter of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were to take on the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were pulled out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with whipped cream.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oute.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and compared to the pressure that I was 17 year old felt to fit me with a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read him, thought, questioned, doubted, and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepened in every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you fully understands you, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started as all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- as we drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I feared the first time I was to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard, and I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Do not attend to you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings said:" "" "" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">Understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, torn apart and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have repelled the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerant views of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">First, the person is cut off from her church, even from her family so that the extremists of extremists believe that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or apostate.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">"" "" "" "but we would add ourselves to their imaginations, when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam returned to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque guard her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, there are at least three things happening.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather backed military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two polling periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terrorism as I expected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective debt it is not just about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his resume. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did I become such an accomplished young man out of my brother?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about which America would leave us to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall, and what I saw left me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker's thinker working in a noble thought factory, so an exception rather than the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't fool you. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking for Muslims around the world and I did it with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want welfare for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionary business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and in general to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest level e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailgate,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter in which position the flight device is able to regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that come to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the mono-winner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rusters, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I watch all is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospa is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is quite symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">Once flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propellers airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others counter clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly, if restricted too.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by doing half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway a particularly safe machine would like to be a flying shade-shade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled together in a very far distant galaxy, and so the mass of three suns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us prescribe the events at first for a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of especially Mueller -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer Book of Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, ligo was launched for a last test run in order to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes penetrated through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, this was the fruit of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their by observatories such as ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squeezed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, instructors in courses on the theory of relativity often lead a really liberal dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and duck."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and plunged when the waves were hit. the stretch of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. that's why the ligo employees were driving for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and certainly all obstacles will be overcome with the support of the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to ligo. Scott likes to claim that ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice talks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies lie in the audible range for ligo.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally listen to the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same pair of pens with an additional key change. that sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of vocabulary, engraved in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Someone who knows what to hear does recognize this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times each sun, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle one hundred times a second before collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens up an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them all over the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, ligo found things that we did not expect from the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the League project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as ligo they are watching, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the mess bones for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say "Yes!" I was afraid of.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to live on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, my fear removed.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, on an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all "estimations" for unexplained reasons,</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she had a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"I guess I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "Yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things look like you get to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode each nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run after one another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I created myself and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country, or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming of dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a portrait of a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, that buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a hum then you cannot strive for size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than to aspire to size doesn't matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of premature failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more exaggerated boundaries, the more work there is, the more I am writing, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land that I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the hum, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single work of work.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says," "" "" "" "Well, I want to go to Shonda Land." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "hay you, stupid author Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you work, you love what you do, a teacher, a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things will become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone any more "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a Titan and smoother my sums, and here everything changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters play a lot, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of buzz, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Die Eisner" releases.</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy stroke is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the Titanisum, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe my brain with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totem is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing doesn't seem to me like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better working than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We fly around in the garden, before and behind, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and talks to my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more is not needed.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get up for 15 minutes, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it's important to feel the buzz, to have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I leave and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is about everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the summing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays a journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "" "" "I said yes to less work and to play more." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the summing. the land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things look like, I'm waking you to life.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the skull-brain traumas, the brain is weak and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the correct diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is, however, clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them colourfully to be able to keep track of them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted it at the birth place of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are maturing these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we are mating the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already busy, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury and reimpled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were masked.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in cultivation.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity job.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to some extent, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we masked the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturing.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the major obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to get someone to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First of all, it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable antedence.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is actually dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- might not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rising friends, who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup erect a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are united, our future bleak and our great new technologies wasted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of wasting, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too timid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound like a lot of money until one compares it with the US $5.1 trillion, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflame the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, like in an endless loop, strengthens the pessimism of investors, which, in fear, the prophecy of the ox could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my vow with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "" "" "but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athenic democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The crucial thing about the athenic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two will take place by gradually undermining policy and exposing it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, so sustainably the animals, of which it nourishes, decimated that it starves at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so cannified politics itself, that it harms itself by the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives out demos [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts are deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve human beings and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," to indulge in long conversations with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like, how could it look like having this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of "matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company area: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income is derived from capital and income, and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets] in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Keep in mind that all world trade is traded in this currency -- call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which they favored privileged persons, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global, Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... if we do not, technological development will produce such a sharp decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transmitting this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "likewise, Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am completely confused." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are probably.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, whereas the area where most abdictions - the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say it so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells raiously according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of the year six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">That is to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive rejection line passed through the eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denounce the denial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or minister, who claims to be in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions of the Eurozone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of her life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog-hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website, which shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after you have looked up a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium term, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon has nothing to do for free, do you pick up properly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look at again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many can't remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they embarked on a venture and decided not to make a sitcom of four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic dictates somehow that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of dates for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company of Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dismissal is made.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could forecast data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the worst way -- by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just flawlessly, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data is rapidly channeled into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the individual pieces together in order to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they vie for TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later fatten it with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it is still paying out to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
