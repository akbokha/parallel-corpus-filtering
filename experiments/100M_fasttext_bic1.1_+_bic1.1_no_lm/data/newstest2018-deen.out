Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where teenagers should meet today .
a chapel where it is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card in Munich promotes thr@@ illing stories to days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows that already had to be exciting because the car navigation device showed a green me@@ adow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but especially therefore very enlighten@@ ing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of distribution of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that is not recognized as such .
for cities and villages more detailed maps , so @-@ called exposure sheets , were incorporated into the large general map .
these were created according to the figures of the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighb@@ ors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ isches Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey administration .
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is found in the same way as any other on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison early / today is most impressive in the example of the provin@@ cial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich city district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the rebel@@ lion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming out there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered flags of the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; from which the ground@@ work was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els do not show farmers today any more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival since 18@@ 10 , was actually still a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the Venti@@ lation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse people were once locked with del@@ usions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ own was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ ment . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he pro@@ hi@@ bits the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , and later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the centri@@ fu@@ gal stadium in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ sts in Germany since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth shelter with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in an architectural reference to the origin of the Ir@@ ene Institute , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing attacks .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , Small Business Houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the prec@@ urs@@ ors and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk road takes place .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Federation for the Promotion of Far@@ ab@@ ites issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls upon af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial inci@@ dents occur in the entire state l@@ ately and can be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities who disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately target minorities , caused the group to issue passport warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel over the state during the trip and was arrested by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being charged with a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring money or know relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 Hass@@ an Bre@@ ak , according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the F@@ BI , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country .
the Travel War@@ ning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence project is el@@ em@@ ental
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have acquired a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man CD@@ U town association met together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Pan Dec@@ ision site of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens supplied and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ asse only Regi@@ on@@ ales .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the soft @-@ down project as &quot; element@@ ar important . &quot;
I can &apos;t generate profit on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things have to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pointed out Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not lead to organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are .
it is hoped that the for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of subsidies
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the open area is there@@ with 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 2023 .
from the total cost of EUR 71 500 the half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ s@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers do not go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape preservation line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pres@@ up@@ position is the presence of a funding body marked by the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the area to be enclosed must not be far@@ ed far@@ med ( slope of 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ man F@@ encing Project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the conservation area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - therefore the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axe in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the pres@@ idency &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have landed him if he had done it .
but it att@@ acking its meaning , and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it when the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller lies properly correctly , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who asp@@ ire to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable g@@ arbage of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the ties between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it is meant to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the view@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever wanted to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ person Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 to start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland is developing something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les in her fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which you should watch after a great season which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be part of the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on the podium .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics via Facebook : do not use a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to political principles .
he compl@@ ained of criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union de@@ pl@@ ored him at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hot@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his vot@@ ers and playing his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , which is officially called and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the acts of Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments was nothing but a fac@@ ilitation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the mail addressed some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a past@@ or , not a tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ ed , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happened digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County ended the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of afford@@ ability had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions who critic@@ ised his position on the Am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Great Britain over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ course are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Arch@@ er@@ field links up to the end of the year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ erry has done a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home base .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer inci@@ dents per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
back then there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze , director of the building .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which continues to ob@@ struc@@ t construction work , represents a big problem for the building ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red traffic lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are authorized to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gol@@ land
when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the hou@@ se@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - local as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which was stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car ride with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated board roofs that were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by r@@ ust .
very few Indonesian have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have leaves on our bodies earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed of $ 3.1 billion gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one officer .
Pap@@ ua claims for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tort@@ ured and imprison@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal lands in the 1970 &quot; s were declared genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
Indonesian police only arrested in the region more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is called in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who went to work in the provin@@ cial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the domestic Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter included 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals are che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; You said .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after the inaugur@@ ation of Jok@@ ov@@ is in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them they should turn their lights on .
one of the soldiers fired on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local minister Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten to fall into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hun@@ ts@@ men and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to hau@@ l stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; it says in an official TIME document that has not been released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame does not always know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indonesian , the TIME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw he was dead ... I k@@ issed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief Insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news on the kill@@ ings came only the following day , &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago , in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto was re@@ treating when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fier@@ y dis@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building contractor who refused to take a conscious man into the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who res@@ ides near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ print for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel army claim@@ ing to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the majority of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ ies ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the domestic Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting are subject to international media .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua even though the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch &apos;s dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ even eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press checks means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confin@@ ed to Pap@@ ua &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically seen the OP@@ M supported .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rep@@ lied the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ indul@@ gence offered a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of an victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 m high 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which one acci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the pro @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two wins was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ sentence classics will be preserved to the traditional valuation .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already been made to settle the final in a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in matters of training etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers will bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent of deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items were tra@@ ffi@@ cked at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally moved prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had discovered bel@@ at@@ edly that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was conducted - also found that younger travellers are more aware of the rules .
those ques@@ tioned that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought bot@@ her@@ ed drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally made sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by airport security and how many had done it inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who wear sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look for books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 , Elec@@ thous@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be pleased to present his new Tes@@ la model .
in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number in the announcement of the latest quarterly report : the number of cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k occup@@ ies : 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics repeatedly pointed out that this is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 U.S. dollars and the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations en@@ su@@ e , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
all models will be consolidated in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 will be one million 2020 .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
whoever orders a Model 3 today must reck@@ on with delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines not yet tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are any major delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back because of the rel@@ uc@@ tance of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environment Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt demonstrated the change when its agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is about a deadline for states that took place on 1 October to comply with the standards of O@@ zone in 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection provisions for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations , which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal reserve for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal vocational court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt insi@@ sted that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ lment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often observed the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to set an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who de@@ pl@@ ored EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA mentioned that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure has not yet been voted in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states that the EPA initiated this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ gate &apos;s surprising price change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche we invite the old cemetery are@@ al in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm to a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius &apos; facility a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful location .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of tur@@ mo@@ il to their concern .
Walter Martini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique rural jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ischer Version of the German Version : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von H@@ orb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ bling Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ te Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recogni@@ zable in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; is the third , the beautiful settlement centre of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval y@@ ard@@ house law .
a gent@@ lem@@ an , who built a church , furnished and occupied with a past@@ or , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
related to this was the right to appoint a past@@ or or to propose a new past@@ or to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two Mer@@ ced at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were wrapped and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Hil@@ arius ch@@ urch@@ yard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen retired &quot; as a successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as organis@@ ers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ ingen , on Sunday , July 16 , invite the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with talks by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
name of the village Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
for the finale of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a drink in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade is only used for dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius &apos; facility , which is of importance for tur@@ mo@@ il and hearing @-@ makers .
the friends and promot@@ ers of the tumour are particularly committed to the preservation of home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini under@@ lines .
association wants to be approved by wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal pre@@ condition for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette no wind power stations could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent &quot; wast@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had planned a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf did not appro@@ ve of a formation error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal grounds , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also decl@@ ining , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they are not likely to cause the process to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ets .
already last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen participated indirectly , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured .
two more people were injured slightly .
the country road remained closed for hours .
after police declar@@ ations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch and her car accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion to the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ gel .
town and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the trade association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the residents to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket items .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
domestic companies should also present themselves with their apprenti@@ ces@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; center @-@ shopping shopping . &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the Trade Association and the City go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , discussions with all tra@@ ders and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened again or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city center when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
the idea of over@@ coming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ dened , was said to be king in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with the fact that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump put under pressure after in@@ feed tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump told the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President appe@@ aled to him because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia are ridi@@ culous , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ part@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ pot &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long turn on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen veri@@ fying .
the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked off very real si@@ gh@@ s .
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were logged out by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years there was not one single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps organizing the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
for him , reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual remembrance of the Monroe community that an injus@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a place of jurisdiction lays out a blank@@ et on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but no one was ever accused .
although susp@@ ects remain on its own for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the presidential campaign in the summer .
roughly at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com faces a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the town was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they came from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the murder , &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vi@@ dly , gri@@ pping and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many would like to believe in America no longer exists .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ ly in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief cl@@ an member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors Dar@@ rius Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester cri@@ es out and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he van@@ ished from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona ref@@ utes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched .
&quot; you only have to meet the tough &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends viol@@ ently and swi@@ ft@@ ly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a sad@@ ness is above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays h@@ is@@ sing praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four tens of spectators caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .
they have experienced a damp@@ ening damp@@ ness every nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the final notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe their tears off .
Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
on a table , a white pair of Atlanta at@@ oms over the night with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called just police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding his desk at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is a way inspiring as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will focus on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging against a gigantic six @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall of a wall and a D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of that an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine bo@@ oth@@ s pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine bo@@ oth@@ s - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ zzy Hagen surrounding the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being celebrated in a stor@@ my way , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the high heat back in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 he had to have had a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert over itself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were sub@@ du@@ ed .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have looked forward to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max Quanti@@ ty Works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at the school already in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful wide spectrum that I see here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does this come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start studying in social sciences in winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ m Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you do FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly what irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than in civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , here &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family , must always be individually taken into consideration .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son reduces further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut down its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing .
the job reduction , which the Director General John Fall@@ on announced , predominantly at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4.000 positions were already lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( US $ 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the quick pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul &apos;s Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been viol@@ ated , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violent action taken by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had taken place when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device carried by a person . &quot;
the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops displac@@ ed the T@@ ali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , after which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ordin@@ ances 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by respon@@ ding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in some of the country where cuts have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to re@@ vert a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the r@@ ash of the democr@@ ats and nature groups that are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
municipal council wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn win@@ ches decided to set up a community room in the future senior citizen housing estate .
before the discussion , there is an important piece of information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the area still belongs to the church community , it will still take place , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council suspended such a common area not as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent residence , but openly entered into the congregation .
as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible for funding .
the decision of the decision to signal the investor means that in this regard nobody wants to throw the b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the statement that both saddle - and the surrounding buildings - as well as the shed roof - which reduces the tr@@ uss height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the panel .
it is not that easy for the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not get the right direction , but they lean towards the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I am very busy with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement .
she sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy of anyway weal@@ thy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but gets a real counter@@ value in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s application to ple@@ ad the proposal appropri@@ ately will find three advoc@@ ates .

car Coll@@ ision : Rad@@ ler is flung up on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and severely injured .
as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer way towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer way .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , driving in the same direction , gave him priority .
but when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove onto the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital by a ret@@ ou@@ ial car .
FC Bayern Munich has to give up at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game take action against Dortmund .
with personnel transfer , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund as the first mandatory match for the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich is becoming ever greater at the Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti will also have to ren@@ ounce the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
the min@@ ers Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are also missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has taken the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not good at last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .

hike in the Harz of Star to Star
the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be produced in the Harz Mountains .
this is planned by the Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many visitors .
it combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .
the members want to put tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables is to be supplemented by Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network welcome plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the star@@ ship train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewer experience a lot of things worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , the Uni @-@ Stadt has been on the initiative of the Friends Planet@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the planned st@@ arb@@ ase - the planet path .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the single planets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth is shr@@ inking on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun , exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ h@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Club Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Boxing Club Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time , both com@@ bat@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down on lightweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he has to move on lightweight tanks &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ h@@ enko vo@@ iced her .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must struggle with a 135 pound debut this year to settle in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also attracted interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their light weight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later op@@ ted to fight on the network offering the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appe@@ aled to Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought in his generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thought the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ stop . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show percussion , then boxing .
they both said that they could sense the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right in the gu@@ err@@ illa where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 towards the north was blocked for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left @-@ hand side of the road was passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three @-@ dimensional chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the 2 : 2 at the start of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the optim@@ ising of the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first races of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , there would not be the two counter@@ parts at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a free hit the Fort@@ resses don &apos;t want to capture themselves anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in the preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the supply chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ position chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford so much play mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is driving to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cups , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I leave the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh , since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ ension in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland are the light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so funk@@ el does not want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ te medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
they should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some of the refugees .
up to now , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; probably 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about their age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person examined is 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det in@@ quired 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institut , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safe , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full on the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proce@@ eding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hold E@@ cht , head of construction at the Road Engineering Department and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehab@@ ilit@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side .
this is a rim attachment , which is also used as a mode of operation .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge should be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is supposed to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of cables through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special feeling of intu@@ ition .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting anten@@ nas in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Valley entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the costs for the three bridge alloys are 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful Prot@@ est with German potato salad
it does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the District Day of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle is inviting R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the town picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; at the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful image that is offered .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; it &apos;s great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police ordered a lot of police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for a cancellation at first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirche there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at around 8@@ pm a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , provides various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe lad .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch talking about their spe@@ eches .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ Event lasts , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock to ti@@ dy up .
the police can move away - no special inci@@ dents .

a re@@ union with the Wolfgang Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the serie Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners of numerous international competitions and have played solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart Spe@@ aks of Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I would like to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly spoke about her bis@@ ex@@ uality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the brunette dar@@ stell@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I had gone .
or do you think I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered under &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but at school time when she felt like a boy dressed : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening in a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and plenty of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the regime change from Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party which would hin@@ der us rather than working to make our country a great one . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an evident exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been carved out of gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress backed the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships starting on Friday in London , following strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a res@@ etting .
drug tests are still inadequate and banned co@@ aches are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council .
act of mour@@ ning for Mali &apos;s crashed soldiers
at a funer@@ al service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar about 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the yet un@@ solved fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their discipline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from North H@@ esse have died a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead@@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funer@@ al service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Insp@@ ector of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gro@@ oms@@ men laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and ready to use .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belonged , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funer@@ al the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Henri@@ k does not want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Henri@@ k ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agre@@ es with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message .
where Prince Henri@@ k is buried is still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home .
Prince Henri@@ k never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also re@@ tires the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Henri@@ k in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French ari@@ sto@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife , Prince Henri@@ k had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
Henri@@ k vo@@ iced in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of soci@@ o @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , following the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising exit of a Green Party member from her state @-@ day faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen proposed her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ys@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
so CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the parliament of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now , the relation was the other way round .
the new Parliament will be elected as a regular date on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is , however , indispensable for Stephan Wei@@ l that the Parliament resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Minister @-@ President draws on trust and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ row@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ously checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yu@@ cat@@ a &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a little curious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens urged the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we naturally assume that they have returned to their country @-@ day emb@@ assy , which they received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the regional president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to conduct a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in front of the background that there were no content differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the Lower Saxony Green Party MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason to vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant vanity and in her frustr@@ ations her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised Social Democratic Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony contributes to this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and attempts to strike political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen CD@@ U @-@ Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen of dist@@ ort@@ ing the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal career presents .
at that time , the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s most powerful force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in parliament .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal last ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the German Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has been dis@@ connected without delay and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ appearance in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment are available for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade has just as well as producers care to ensure that the products sold are road@@ worthy and harmless to health .
if eggs have exceeded the maximum value of 0.00@@ 5mg / kg , they are not b@@ usi@@ ble .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage based on presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always there is too little control in case of emergency .
is it only missing at the personnel or on the coher@@ ent competence ?
it was just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to exclusively obtain safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ ghtly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved swi@@ ft@@ ly and seam@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the soccer rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to beat teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid € 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can certainly make the money loose in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich host family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they have to deal with legitimate income sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player thought that clubs , who had enormous debt in their pursu@@ it of success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year opening period running until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
despite the fact that Plat@@ ini has fallen in popularity from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to deter him from excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we &apos;ll definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the flow rates for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 44,@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 paved the way for the PSG ProntoSIL with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ w@@ it their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies connected with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist enterprise could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not have to be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the PS@@ A sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by Qatar &apos;s Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be made over payments from the 2022 World Cup Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar will be the World Cup ambass@@ ad@@ ors , and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators will be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that , with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros , PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot acqu@@ isitions .
the association assumes that sales after signature will increase by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claim@@ ing that PSG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PSG .
ar@@ sen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and it has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chim@@ ney supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the job .
Swiss Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white ch@@ ill@@ boards of up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a shot manufacturer .
Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss since 2006 , the Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates will distribute chocolate tablets on board their flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ leb@@ aut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
for two and a half years , Swiss introduced the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y for two and a half years .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long hau@@ l flights the customers of First Class are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business as well as in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to wet Hot American Summer and &quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ d@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by divi@@ ding themselves to the core of the g@@ ag - middle aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - yet they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody Go@@ es more after the g@@ able figure principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sha@@ kes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character sho@@ ots through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot included in Ron@@ ald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ d@@ d , who shows Matt Di@@ rie &apos;s under@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise like a repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; Wet Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ to @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , gives the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ bo@@ iled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dial@@ ogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful flags for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensure a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Reag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long epis@@ odes it is getting there , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; COM@@ RA@@ DE Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited on a smaller length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist public is that the Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
strike on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have made a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar circle in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused of age between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
the officials also ensured greater quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore presum@@ ably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
in total , more than 300 police officers were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised crime , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the summer of 2016 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General has established Con@@ stance against organised drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
this was the reason why the large deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four Palermo officials .
the investigations focused mainly on Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
wise compl@@ ains large gaps in foreign regi@@ sters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the data recorded there could result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes serious mistake decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in a way that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by around 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can considerably slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics on people who are travelling on holiday , EU citizens are covered that would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders lead to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they came from there .
this comes out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ru@@ de Newspaper . &quot;
in paper , it says that the BA@@ MF is leading such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children , since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening human rights in the Italian asylum system because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the repeated read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions performed in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre &apos;s house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ spann@@ er were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations .

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , since weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary over the next few years in order to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs may be likely to rise more than expected in financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business cycle , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the upcoming February , although it is said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households is still under consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; higher level &quot; than the markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the down@@ ward correction of the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest income and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the latest inflation report has little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , since the ti@@ ghtening is getting worse first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumer spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the collapse of the boy@@ cot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final judgement on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the excess in proportion to their target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ fort , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent drop in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks very good for those in whom the existing dealers are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing out , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
patients will be able to gain access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in late September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS United Kingdom announced that pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis taken before the sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Head Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission in the case of infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to taking intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sex@@ uals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified , who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gender individuals and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS United Kingdom signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , aimed at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not subject to a negoti@@ ating with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said , &quot; The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .

living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced itself from a large home in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne forgot to add storage space and an mezzanine to make full use of the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to over@@ lap two rooms , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window looks down from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ tain lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite astonishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million property empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a con@@ frontation because of one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
one court file says that this means Col@@ in has ownership of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the Brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true but th@@ rows Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both parties held lawyers law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L Management Board and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contact Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried t@@ aming tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when the candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter Hab@@ its under control according to six former election campaign officers insi@@ sted that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets without their interventions have even more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his colleagues managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advis@@ ers to supply dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press excer@@ pts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they origin@@ ate from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article of Got@@ news , the web site of Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has spoken false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House General , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe send mail to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the chosen heavy crimin@@ als are naturally not known , information from the population will be hoped and requested .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent Calendar of winter .
the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ ets hide at vacation destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 , the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online dic@@ tion@@ aries could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the announcement of the publication on the website .
travelers will negoti@@ ate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Number &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with a few determined travellers on war foot@@ wear , who have negoti@@ ated a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street called Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull saying that it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless for dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back again .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour with the police , calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise gets from Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues generated by the local tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke of serious seek@@ ers at the house back then .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been a building plot container before the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , blank@@ ets were broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should become &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing himself .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with about 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already managed talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause .
the noti@@ ons of the city are the same as those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the outdoor spaces are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is built , which is open to the public by the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Jury Sets Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panel took up work over the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper wrote the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already preliminary charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men should stand who acted as advis@@ ers of the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
report@@ edly Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps in private and business environment .
several weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump personally moved into the centre and investig@@ ating whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Y@@ ur@@ ys are therefore also called the dressing @-@ chambers .
in most cases , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office to charge individuals under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ charges were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , as well as his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were involved in the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the en@@ roll@@ ment shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about appo@@ inting a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special investig@@ ator in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement .
Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ ash , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump urged him to set up investigations against the former National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special educ@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether or not Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
unlike an independent exp@@ orter of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ alled president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could not be dism@@ issed so easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the ice shelf .
that was shared by the Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the big col@@ os@@ sus of about 1 tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres is now driving nor@@ th@@ wards and will probably need two , three years , until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest iron gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research information , to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg is uncle@@ ar .
but there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ e so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was dis@@ rupted the balance of growth and breaking a few years ago .
a complete scra@@ p is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger as well , because the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and ice the water as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice sheet leads to the fact that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for ob@@ serving Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it &apos;s a natural happening and we don &apos;t know any direct connection to climate change , the Eis@@ schild is now entering a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , many of the polar farms in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have collap@@ sed in the past decades .
this long skirt of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the District Day opened 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them .
the apprenti@@ ces@@ hips at the circle are apparently very sought @-@ after .
around 620 applications were recorded for the seats that were to be missed this year .
nevertheless , the group still l@@ acks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the short@@ age of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out a concept for recru@@ iting and developing personnel according to the wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for new@@ com@@ ers and involve a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he was a la@@ zy surprise already in the cra@@ y@@ day , when he publicly ques@@ tioned the costs of personnel costs and start@@ led the remaining parties .
people want all possibilities to be verified that permit exit from the communal employers &quot; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t get to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should strive for a house tari@@ ff in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are now exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher tier that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone for NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis was warning a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had effectively worked with tra@@ ffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the alleg@@ ations made by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew adop@@ ts infl@@ atable migrants , which are delivered to them directly by tra@@ ffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the file of the Prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of ob@@ serving the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to over@@ board an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel Prize winner organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in recent weeks , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined shar@@ ply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine wick@@ er bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy tri@@ als and attractions for four days .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were again and again longer climb@@ s , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gears up for e @-@ sport
will the sport stars sit in front of computer con@@ soles in the future , instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium ra@@ ids in wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
these have also recognized the first federal alli@@ ances that are increasingly involved in this field .
the start was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg in 2015 , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people will go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the asi@@ an ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could far more often be present on these markets than to send the Federal Republic of Germany to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA cont@@ ested at the competition level .
as in normal sport , Li@@ ège has long established itself in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ os@@ y has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in the classic sport - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and quick responsi@@ veness are needed .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the F@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but the rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport lack@@ ed .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study of the consulting services Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
that is little bit less against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consulting .
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport competition off@@ erer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , she says .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are meanwhile required to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany lag@@ s behind in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough .
it &apos;s about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time al@@ ig@@ ning the company on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything stays the same as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter is convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy ref@@ uses to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who res@@ um@@ ed his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in her eyes , folded hands and down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility over it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has not shown regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not want to mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that it encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow resident in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter is worthy of compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning the New Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain on the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern won a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his seat in the cab , that was Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he made his ha@@ ste to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the in@@ lay could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach was also able to interpret Kim@@ i in such a way .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had just arrived from the holidays , but he was chosen as a guide .
you prefer to distribute sugar to those you want to keep a lot of things that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who were chosen to adopt the heritage of L@@ el can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fli@@ pping over the field as a mini l@@ ame .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white tie at the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ i was also working in this initial formation , like the one who can take the helm in his hand .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V demand - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turning point sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 there will be construction law .
the West Bank of Trier is also playing a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic route plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ General Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it as a guide to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Industry and Commerce ) is seeking to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in the wine region in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company praised the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the completed master exam and 2500 Euro , when graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , but at the same time it is out of the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers that Wis@@ sing wants to hire at state @-@ owned mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bald@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U faction refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 than suggested in the receipt of country roads .
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to fix the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band extension in the country is so@@ ber@@ so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a rating of 3.4 .

Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than restrictions &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be modified to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sp@@ ear@@ ing down the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s faults , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ dow@@ ns which regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but re@@ trac@@ ted to normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and an enquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could heavily poll@@ ute Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the win of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar

if you pass the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between the Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ b@@ ach@@ bridge .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Bau@@ refer@@ at wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a great inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artists were inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ dium figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still on the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , plus@@ hes and clo@@ cks continue to find a lot of dis@@ sem@@ ination around the world .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ r@@ ying .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought and because of the disease @-@ borne bugs , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions can cause major head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ iss , an expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively threatened because in recent years the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has an effect on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil does not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant @-@ ears with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the killing of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make Mexico &apos;s chaos dangerous .
there is no break @-@ off from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the odo@@ ci@@ ce building . two Rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smile with glasses or his typical pan@@ de@@ mic .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ers associated with drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are dis@@ comfor@@ ting , and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we di@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa anyone or more people are shot dead on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , they assumed power members bought every copy of the issue as soon as she was delivered to the newspaper ki@@ osk .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country to its own security , following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ Dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ orters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in Pers@@ ec@@ ution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you consider as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ z team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the sp@@ a@@ ß@@ bird , who like a do@@ cking worker , could curse the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for a routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ z Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ al@@ oa - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
no cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where the staff from Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce met for safety training . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were mand@@ ated by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the rep@@ orters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has co@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an exposure to the state expenditure concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped , or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter experienced from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the ruling institution@@ alist revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source about kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs .
in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down on walking paths and buildings in organized protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re@@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her fur@@ y has viol@@ ated obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and indiffer@@ ent society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the media coverage group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;

din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ ghtening .
now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
his incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he hit something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only bl@@ ink a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a screening technique known as a counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family first made head@@ lines in May and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ im@@ ch@@ elli named Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or across his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the tap@@ estry is common , the results are surprising , as the size of bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure were hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the disgu@@ ise of con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable to loo@@ t , indicating that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s skin was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea where he sunk on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the time of chal@@ k was a time when huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six @-@ ton@@ ed heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the under@@ sea funer@@ al of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the front door still covers b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
preserved remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ es .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long st@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first indications of the police , at 17.00 , between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were crashing down .
there is no indication of the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a roughly ten @-@ kilomet@@ re back @-@ back was formed .
as reported by an AZ @-@ rep@@ orter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle &apos;s cab , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was another accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
German rail@@ ways : the Group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing remin@@ is@@ cent is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and just has an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes a ru@@ de or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket insp@@ ections .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you have taken your seat and de@@ valu@@ ables the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we &apos;ll expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available early next year on many more distant routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already will most passengers do anyway .
you must also have bought it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for electronic evaluation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and the booked seat Y has taken .
if the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at the ticket control at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel through our train atten@@ d@@ ant without ticket inspection , simply check yourself in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest off@@ ences .
for often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that you have to assign .
the consequence is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , leading to poor mood in the compartment or greater room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own tickets and the artist at the end takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
other net numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ os@@ e@@ Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Por@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live to twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off in order to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video she said , another polic@@ eman took his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ eping . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of man &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and fill the streets to demand answers .
as a fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them with me , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel it would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other n@@ atives followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; documents reveal the surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women have to bear the burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film based on their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news @-@ cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the congregation and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , as well as the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be exactly planned on the grounds on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the hou@@ se@@ wives very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent will be reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what kind of shopping bust in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous .
there is plenty of it in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
since there is not even a ti@@ dy weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented only by bigger companies in a shopping center , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for retailers .
too bad , special deals are almost no longer and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go there during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will actually arrive at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost@@ ing bit gallery already manage to drive away all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but there is no place for a farmers market hall thanks to the ma@@ dness of many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
if the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
there are many faces in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being publicly known as a secret report on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing resem@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable analog@@ y ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and pioneering president , who was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
due to the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like , a sharp , though some intellectual commentary not only lead to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also created for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Bra@@ d@@ ley Edward , but had spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie where M@@ anning obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger V@@ isions &apos; .
in this the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprison@@ ed mice became un@@ equal bri@@ ph@@ ews , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ ny would transform judgment and able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is even now at the opening of the exhibition something low and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump conduc@@ ts a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ ames the rigid divisions that he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning asked for their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is furnished with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose basis has been sex , race , sex@@ uality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des based on the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how surprisingly similar , at least in biological aspects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , 0 . 0 Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a site from the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned com@@ ic novel .
it shows M@@ anning how it emerg@@ es with a hands @-@ free telephone in the hand from the disciplinary regions of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they cold up your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the center of the room by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , who gather as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder
a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were searched for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday the arrest warran@@ ts were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a communal warning system issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigate the p@@ ens as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been a associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them is now in absence and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to surrender .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , which said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that lay and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza has published an explanation for the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM was comm@@ enting on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause a concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ing said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded from the WA@@ DA in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and co @-@ ordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ secretary wanted to measure happiness in your e @-@ commerce @-@ start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ salvation , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to provide employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ Suite managers to b@@ ypass and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ secretary said she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it provides a heat card of the company , which at a glance shows which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Services could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
a client has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent company lets companies send bes@@ po@@ ke &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats his employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden by executives , who were sitting in offices in cities or states , can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practic@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said V@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment li@@ tigation . &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ y secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies are running well . companies operate well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks associates after your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not following , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said V@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real pedal for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually length@@ ened its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed time plans of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the br@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood passed practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s regul@@ ating change even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they moved on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel belonging to the up@@ scale class , which has already been dropped by foot pe@@ eling , which is a protection grid behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ amt that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then stop to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send it to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that might display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks , if they fail to eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new facts check was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; apart from finding out which stories of fac@@ tual audi@@ tors are challenged third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they &apos;re reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related products &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a slip @-@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ ol@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; stretches from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb strain ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was lit for the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .
alas , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting ) it seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he went through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape gar@@ den@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only got the full access in 2006 when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards representing what possessed : &quot; you could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch struggling to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all of it ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant u@@ prising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant u@@ prising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was represented from the 18th century , who staged his own funer@@ al by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite mer@@ ry to always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men qu@@ ench their school crises by mar@@ r@@ ying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ fall . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium built in the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle vei@@ led in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , the mayor , Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team , want to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan secretly .
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website free of charge yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single ple@@ dge , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can afford an average five @-@ digit amount and costs the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pension plans and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consult@@ ations .
thus , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in number .
the government re@@ ins the re@@ ins in the military .
according to Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were removed .
since the coup , head of state Erd@@ og@@ an 169 has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 48@@ 6 people who were allegedly involved in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an referred to the overthrow attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he had the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an really put the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the big rein@@ forc@@ ements in the army and the security forces continue .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 73@@ 95 government taxes , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an specifically promoted an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; within a few years .
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO indiffer@@ ent .
anyway , there are doubts about the operational read@@ iness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the media .
it intends to reduce legal migrants to € 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are dealt green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
mini@@ stri@@ es want to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate route for road shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , it has been argu@@ ed about the future of the race agency - now it is going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the railway line on which the tourist train runs is scheduled to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race for the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works will start in this year .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the road Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; said State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will currently be fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ia train as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the rac@@ er @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot plant in the past few months , it has been tested if the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the route is also very bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt his robot accordingly to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step @-@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she has her m@@ oods over the course of the day - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one walks a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bing one most .
on its site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consum@@ er@@ ism .
but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not od@@ dly or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ iled to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out bodies and the stu@@ ff@@ ed eyes , but how realis@@ tically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ bl@@ ance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( alb@@ eit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not really women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a tr@@ ash wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that the US vot@@ ers have pol@@ arized must also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the hor@@ r@@ ors of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all say to us all to let our filter bu@@ bbles pop .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone familiar with it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but in another context it is noticeable that this ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day his babies will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed .
there is , however , an even more fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York car@@ ous@@ el &apos;s car@@ ous@@ el , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and the climate @-@ changing music con@@ veys this in a curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage in fact - the Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage matters not - it is a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but lu@@ ck@@ ily nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olog@@ ous while I was tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us rel@@ oc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which , according to the prison authorities , suffered a fall in his cell .
he was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by fir@@ ing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appe@@ ase this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it was too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door @-@ eag@@ les from F@@ hat@@ s and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the school dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eagle who grows in the chicken farm , but then dism@@ issed in freedom .
to do this , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch away from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken swe@@ eping a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it struck , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ dd@@ les , the cylinders bearing the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young @-@ animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose was to be free .
she desired each quartet to feel accepted in his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who always jum@@ ps back in class@@ room p@@ etting , and the parents of the parents .
the time of ch@@ ick is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she only divor@@ ced her students after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they have been able to rely on the four @-@ door @-@ eag@@ les .
at the end of the day , all students made a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first led@@ gers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camp in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened control over the free camp and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .

the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa gives an estim@@ ation :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the managed software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced quick implementation within the next few months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler has notified each person affected .
if any inspection is due anyway , it will be settled in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it may be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW corporation ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tire , such as S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a risk of a massive fall in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J received Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first Rap@@ per to receive one of the prestigious awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
therefore , the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced that he would not attend the g@@ ala .
the New York Times said , &quot; This pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
Est@@ ef@@ an &apos;s 59 @-@ year @-@ old stressed that she will take advantage of the discussion with Tr@@ ump in order to clarify their views .
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the job is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker City Builder since 31 years .
and the work always makes him a lot of fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible time .
this should - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a Lower Building Law Authority for the Board of Directors , the applicant must show corresponding agreements .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and to himself , &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a district and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot has been initiated .
the k@@ ine@@ ties between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject to change .
the latter will be be@@ ating around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it properly , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in design , there is a great game room for a city building master .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and nur@@ ser@@ y , it is possible to react flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned in praise by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is classified as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the reti@@ ring city master .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ er@@ meister has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long @-@ standing employees in the event of care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with this place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to be hei@@ r to Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with speci@@ alisation in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning .
the municipal building department under@@ lies civil engineering and civil engineering , structural planning , under@@ mining , administration of municipal real estate , urban estate with building yard and municipal gar@@ dening , as well as lower construction supervisory authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : southern railway line blocked
according to the police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway bridge over the Le@@ oben road ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
a pink rolling and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene of the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a slice of Lus@@ ati@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have put themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the railway traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delayed arrival and the cost of rail replacement traffic , even P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without any disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday mor@@ nings , two of which were related to the long hau@@ l traffic .
freight deduc@@ tions did not fall out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the UK , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penet@@ rate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammatory intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also work with people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , who had been accommod@@ ated separately , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om@@ es of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells were found , but they lack@@ ed mice .
mice were treated in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop these types of immune cells , and they were obtained by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of the mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tracts .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho also wished three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority new obligations .
&quot; getting three of four , thanks to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still a SPD leader , S &amp; D prime @-@ pres@@ idents always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only no fire from the party center , but no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the election war@@ ri@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have observed the events in the SPD @-@ governed provin@@ cial capit@@ als .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Euro MP Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , the president of the Gre@@ ens , threw the government into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Federal President Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the elect@@ or@@ ate .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign leader of the Green Party of the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaign si@@ gh@@ s when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ban reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , President of the Social Democratic Party of Lower Saxony , is standing after the over@@ coming of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without his own majority .
it is the pro@@ visional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what will happen next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this was done - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly .
the comrades were struggling again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the context of crisis communication , he made pretty much everything wrong , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for quite some time now .
mi@@ ese conversion values were added .
despite this , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the band .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ covered by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty on the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Mr Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen .
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen puts her own career over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but by the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , thus the lower @-@ Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that it returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the election of the elect@@ or@@ ate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD as a candidate for the German elections , the ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member de@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding Guide for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
those who want to be rehab@@ ilit@@ ated in the year &apos;s house may soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the ST@@ EC City Development Ministry announced on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the event , Sch@@ in@@ dler has again given a review of what is happening .
since 1991 , there have been some sen@@ ti@@ ent refurb@@ ishment areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the total assets .
in the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
the present renov@@ ations are a &quot; success object &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler . finally , it is important to also promote interior development , not only to tap into new building areas .
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the total assets amounted to 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 came from the country , the rest of the municipality sen@@ timent .
how is a san@@ itation area created ?
one will further investigate Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per property , carried out .
the renovation area would then finally be set out as a charter .
the grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the inventory in the framework of those involved in the restructuring area to fill out a questionn@@ aire .
in November or December , the order decision should be carried out as far as possible so that the renov@@ ations can be started next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary examinations .
it is about evalu@@ ating and deci@@ ding when to evaluate the city &apos;s gri@@ ev@@ ances when it is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come back to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and Land Rainbow &quot; which , among other things , is concerned with the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment .
in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary and housing , &quot; information about the size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be made .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building .
however , it must be noted that a completed questionn@@ aire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler realis@@ es that the distribution of funds is working according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
you cannot reserve funds for later .
finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the attendance a &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now implemented both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that has highlighted the American manufacturing last month costs tax pay@@ ers according to the information provided by the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , produced in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al engineer for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 : 00 p.m. and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the flight depart@@ ing from the White House should be delayed , a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
out of the recordings made available , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the dep@@ uty commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but demanding their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is delighted with the Show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters fled additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the load for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibit@@ ing helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not accommodate bud@@ get@@ ing for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for workshop rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the ref@@ unds for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump interact with the helicopter while he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump was talking to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga ki@@ cks off with the SV in the third place of the championship .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel in the third place of the European Parliament .
despite five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable , the leader of the Second Tennis League had the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Sw@@ ab@@ dor@@ fer SV , the imports from the high north are above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ us@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is becoming hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good deal of happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the French active Fr@@ ench@@ man is not currently playing the Bundes@@ liga with the Chall@@ enger Tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play during the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) during this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was still in the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vic@@ tories against the Club on the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one in the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ erst@@ ab around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay re@@ fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his capacity to en@@ force the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress wrapped up a few un@@ constitutional rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russi@@ ans to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors have been al@@ armed with the local OM@@ V , which jointly co @-@ finan@@ ces the construction of the Russian East Coast North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump , himself , would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved to the centre of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who un@@ v@@ eils Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series has not been over for a long time yet .
the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the newest bad@@ dies of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four mighty god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise , &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban centers of kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
it continues to be bo@@ iled out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooled cooled water .
the town operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld district , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past day of the day , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children eat in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 2@@ pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time professionals have kitchen service starting on 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , complement it with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions of the meal individually , give away food , swe@@ ep away , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the hour circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen ladies now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for Kit@@ al@@ eit@@ ung to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team would make sense .
also suitable for children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be completed by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign award for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people in the field of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling from the Council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provin@@ cial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the T@@ ali@@ ban published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will make the power peaceful by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elect@@ oral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million registered vot@@ ers .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ g@@ ow
a union would like to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie make sure that they have long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glas@@ g@@ ow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had out@@ weigh@@ ed the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , besides other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; experience &quot; as the first if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB senior organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members .
generations of families have worked here and labour forces strongly focus on the local community and the large @-@ scale Glas@@ g@@ ow region , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic production decline , Glas@@ g@@ ow &apos;s eastern end urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
one spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received only yesterday a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with co @-@ workers and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in their pursu@@ it of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris , Saint @-@ Germain , will not pursue after it has issued an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release cl@@ ause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record raid ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board indicates that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expres@@ sing interest in the PSG mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PSG clearly made it impossible for the International from Italy to iron under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator deliberately kno@@ cked down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 euros on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for cl@@ ues .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and hit the steering plan .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to switch to the right .
at the same time the Tour leader touched the steering plan .
at the passenger car , kind of damage arose .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now invite witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause of the poll@@ u@@ ter to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse inci@@ dents reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are a church , &quot; declared after publication from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger were expres@@ sing their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
the Vatican Tour &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed the fact that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ ans , &quot; double standards &quot; were measured .
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is also said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ out fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stripes had been a normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports of abuse , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
absolutely wrong , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memory band &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he ass@@ esses the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg to the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer , Ulrich Weber ?
altogether 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ j@@ tiles .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that R. In many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could also be more violent .
in contrast to many other def@@ end@@ ants , however , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , have even had positive memories associated with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of victims of violence against prot@@ ect@@ ants at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphasize his humanity .
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perf@@ ection@@ ist that was pal@@ p@@ able to the ful@@ ler when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
for him , eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , know about it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , in which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also out@@ lines a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by children of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to acute out@@ breaks .
that he didn &apos;t just b@@ ang with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also gave ear @-@ fig@@ s and too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys to the hair or ears , he himself gave himself a few years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ uses for it .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods in the period of question , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely dis@@ semin@@ ated among parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it actually deals with in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one already asks oneself if it is not more of his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
many who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also involved in the final report any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the context of the abuse inci@@ dents ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tioned student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective cul@@ pri@@ t .
I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that all of it ... Bu@@ ben have opened intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or more , than against their parents , boarding schools , confi@@ d@@ ant teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment had been entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of everyone .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contrary crimes , as happened in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; violent eating &quot; was read at the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; report .
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is , in turn , a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clear separation : between the primary school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really squ@@ ared and mal@@ adjusted , and were dre@@ ad@@ ful , all met at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have reigned .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; was tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have been taken away .
yet despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported on the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only around 1993 .
was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently joining the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to practice the punishment punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press release , he received an urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ishments were also banned in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us is still aware of .
it was difficult for him to estimate that the persons concerned might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test sentence was officially abol@@ ished at schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we hist@@ ori@@ ans speak of the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of ass@@ essing the past according to modern moral standards .
the pr@@ incess was right there .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times and not for what has been broken down in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is all horri@@ ble and I am glad that it is finally done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the same time I have to take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and pun@@ ish , that is to say to the ear and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play with you in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ?
was the subject of a test sentence also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , re@@ counts from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I was by no means conce@@ aling that he carried a strict reg@@ iment there .
but that must also be said : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone one does not make a big singer and before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ winding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and warm @-@ heart@@ ed people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only hurt a fly .
I regularly get in touch with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he once was strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ici@@ ans are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look at and ad@@ ore them today .
and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are education methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be glad that we have long overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the starting point would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no @-@ one would know the Regensburg @-@ based Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
