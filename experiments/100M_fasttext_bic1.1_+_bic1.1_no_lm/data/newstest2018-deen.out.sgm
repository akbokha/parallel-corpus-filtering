<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where teenagers should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel where it is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card in Munich promotes thrilling stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that already had to be exciting because the car navigation device showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but especially therefore very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of distribution of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and villages more detailed maps, so-called exposure sheets, were incorporated into the large general map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the figures of the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographisches Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is found in the same way as any other on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is most impressive in the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich city district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming out there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flags of the so-called "Urge" from which the groundwork was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small parcels do not show farmers today any more - but small gardeners of the" "" "" "" "Land in Sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the October festival since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the Ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Circle-Irrenown was created "On the Auer Lüftment."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the ankle of so-called Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibits the personnel to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, and later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the centrifugal stadium in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianum meet on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth shelter with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in an architectural reference to the origin of the Irene Institute, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "main square" in 1856, the shopping street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, Small Business Houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the precursors and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk road takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Farabites issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls upon afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial incidents occur in the entire state lately and can be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities who disproportionately target minorities, caused the group to issue passport warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that people pass." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel over the state during the trip and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, showing that black motorists in the state will be halted 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring money or know relatives to travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri reported 100 Hassan Break, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Travel Warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisherman CDU town association met together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Pan Decision site of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many kittens supplied and accommodated in five apartments Feriengaste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengasse only Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he described the soft-down project as "elementar important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "" "" "pointed out Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the forestation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of subsidies</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is therewith 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of EUR 71 500 the half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fishersbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers do not go." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß asserted: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape preservation line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-of-the-art promotion of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presupposition is the presence of a funding body marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the area to be enclosed must not be fared farmed (slope of 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherman Fencing Project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The conservation area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - therefore the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the presidency's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it attacking its meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies properly correctly, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who aspire to breathe freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when the" "" "" "" "eleventh waste" "" "" "" "on our screens was better to be seen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the ties between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way in the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles in her fifth world championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir carries on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which you should watch after a great season which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be part of the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team capitals is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics via Facebook: do not use a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He complained of criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union deplored him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his voters and playing his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially called and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the acts of Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a facilitation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail addressed some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassed, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, they are regarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the Governor's employees described as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam" "" "" "" "would probably call" "" "" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trump is complained by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County ended the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordability had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions who criticised his position on the Amity treaty, trade and shipping with Great Britain overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="259">An existing movement, which was stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport was mined of $3.1 billion gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a stifling presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military units and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in one officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papua claims for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papua's tribal lands in the 1970 "s were declared genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.</seg>

<seg id="289">The former carpenter included 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="290">But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals are cheated.</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You said.</seg>
<seg id="292">In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after the inauguration of Jokovis in October.</seg>
<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them they should turn their lights on.</seg>
<seg id="295">One of the soldiers fired on their tone and later returned with four soldiers, so the local minister Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="296">The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">A child, 16-year old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten to fall into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They wore ceremonial huntsmen and carried the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - from Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some protesters began to haul stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood was heated, the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio: "if the masses are resisting more than three times, they shoot it dead," it says in an official TIME document that has not been released by the local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto-district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.</seg>
<seg id="305">No one was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, suddenly I was shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="307">Kayame does not always know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here.</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," he added.</seg>

<seg id="315">According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="316">The news on the killings came only the following day, "filtered" to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">Three weeks ago, in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="318">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="336">The shootings have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building contractor who refused to take a conscious man into the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But local people say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting and killing one.</seg>

<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament called upon the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an imprint for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by increasing sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken in custody, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep the majority of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupies (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time, economic inequalities between the domestic Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own businesses competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting are subject to international media.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua even though the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia-Director, the promises of Jokovis campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's uneven eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a black list," "" "" "" "he said in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press checks means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua including Paniai Shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically seen the OPM supported.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, replied the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks."</seg>

<seg id="375">Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua will say that they will probably not vote for Jokovi.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were trafficked at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally moved prohibited knives or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed they had discovered belatedly that they were mistaken for firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was conducted - also found that younger travellers are more aware of the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Those questioned that they knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by TSA were 19.7 percent millennials compared to less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought bothered drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally made smuggling goods by airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It's no surprise that people who wear smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - wear safety, those who fly most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order</seg>
<seg id="421">With the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3, Electhoussassa Elon Musk will be pleased to present his new Tesla model.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far underestimated that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has revealed a different, less glamorous number in the announcement of the latest quarterly report: the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk frequently had recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk occupies: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that this is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 U.S. dollars and the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 455,000 such non-binding reservations ensue, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">Its argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">All models will be consolidated in 2018 - 500,000 will be one million 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Whoever orders a Model 3 today must reckon with delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines not yet tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there are any major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA CEO Pruitt is moving back because of the reluctance of the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of the Environment Protection Agency, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt demonstrated the change when its agency proved to be responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline for states that took place on 1 October to comply with the standards of Ozone in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Attorney General of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection provisions for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations, which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal reserve for the Prusion regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a federal vocational court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt insisted that its reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often observed the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to set an appointment for implementation," "" "" "" "said Pruitt, who deplored EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA mentioned that Pruitt will eventually use his" "" "" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "" "" "to ensure that the rules" "" "" "" "based on a solid policy and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bill approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that the EPA initiated this week, said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the return of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their communities" "" "" "", "Schneiderman said."

<seg id="459">New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="460">Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="461">The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche we invite the old cemetery areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30pm to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius' facility a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful location.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of turmoil to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique rural jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Version of the German Version: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumbling Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamte Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still recognizable in the local image of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" is the third, the beautiful settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval yardhouse law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman, who built a church, furnished and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Related to this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two Merced at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were wrapped and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius churchyard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the "Schaffhausen retired" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters of Tumblingen, on Sunday, July 16, invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with talks by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Name of the village Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the finale of the serenade, there is a drink in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers provide the fantastic view." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade is only used for dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius' facility, which is of importance for turmoil and hearing-makers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of the tumour are particularly committed to the preservation of home care, such as the Serenade organiser Walter Martini underlines.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to be approved by wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim wears itself" "" "" "" "is not a legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the councillor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wears" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind power stations could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent "wasting" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had planned a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days before, but the district government of Dusseldorf did not approve of a formation error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal grounds, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also declining," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim, "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided to re-establish the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "with this, the issuance of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the corresponding letter has been received by district Viersen since last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they are not likely to cause the process to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reasoning of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheim Nets.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city Viersen participated indirectly, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="531">Town and dealer plan "home shopping" weekend</seg>
<seg id="532">Bad Langensalaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shops in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The trade association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to the shopping spree in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers, which offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket items.</seg>
<seg id="535">Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">Domestic companies should also present themselves with their apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "center-shopping shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">In this way, the Trade Association and the City go into another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "active day" to the well-established Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be reopened again or again.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost sight of the city center when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">The idea of overcoming the lethargy with a network, which partly widened, was said to be king in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen shared with the fact that Germany's third "home shopping" day, for the first time, took part in five Thuringian cities.</seg>
<seg id="550">Besides Bad Langensalza this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="551">"" "" "" "the day should" "" "" "" "promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities," "" "" "" "said Streich." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="552">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct surroundings." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="564">Transcriptions of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="565">On 27 January Trump told the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.</seg>
<seg id="566">The US President appealed to him because he denounced the wall publicly. reportedly, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."</seg>
<seg id="567">Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.</seg>
<seg id="568">Transcriptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia are ridiculous, "bad" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade that was imparted by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depot" after he had proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="570">Mr. Trump completed the call after having said Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."</seg>

<seg id="572">A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge from Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, the four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-stripe suit - took a long turn on his cigar and looked at the windscreen verifying.</seg>
<seg id="575">The inmates floated in fear.</seg>

<seg id="580">But when a loop is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience kicked off very real sighs.</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were logged out by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one ever was charged with murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is really inconceivable that in all these years there was not one single person arrested - although we see them in our churches, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks who helps organizing the night. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="589">A place of jurisdiction lays out a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch on 27 July 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the LynchProcess.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although suspects remain on its own for decades, civil rights activists say that double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the presidential campaign in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom faces a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumour in the town was that Hester slept with Malcoms's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to release Malcom from prison, thus the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.</seg>

<seg id="604">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Their representation is vividly, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe in America no longer exists.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we don't want to talk about Lynch because we are confronted with the ugly in all of us," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="609">The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is here Greene co-director.</seg>
<seg id="611">He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.</seg>

<seg id="613">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room rehearsed the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcom, the ester cries out and pushes him, furiously that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "he vanished from my property!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona refutes the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everybody (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, still giggling.</seg>
<seg id="625">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I simply don't think white people at that time" "" "" "" "he" said. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," one of the other black performers witched.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to meet the tough 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">And precisely here the energy shifts in space, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy trying to get this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with reprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violently and swiftly.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are screams, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman clothed with a sadness is above the corpse of the actors and leads Billie Holidays hissing praise "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks in every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four tens of spectators caught sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced a dampening dampness every nearly eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now if one stands on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the final notes of the songs sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they are not really dead," "" "" "" "mumbles a little boy as if he wanted to remember." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the Lynchrope and wipe their tears off.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit, who has played the clan member.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him.</seg>
<seg id="649">"it's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="650">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we know that it is not in your heart." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday, it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut down its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job reduction, which the Director General John Fallon announced, predominantly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4.000 positions were already lost.</seg>

<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaragh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two counterparts, the municipal council of Fluorn winches decided to set up a community room in the future senior citizen housing estate.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although the area still belongs to the church community, it will still take place, but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common space for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council suspended such a common area not as a meeting place for the residents of the senient residence, but openly entered into the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">As an example, the word "Strickcafe" made the round.</seg>
<seg id="756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a common room would be, as reported by Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible for funding.</seg>
<seg id="759">The decision of the decision to signal the investor means that in this regard nobody wants to throw the billets between the legs, the statement that both saddle - and the surrounding buildings - as well as the shed roof - which reduces the truss height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, be this additive.</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: unanimously, he passes the panel.</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not that easy for the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">Daniela's call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not get the right direction, but they lean towards the common room from the window, she says: "I am very busy with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">She sees behind it a covert subsidy of anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsidy, but gets a real countervalue in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigner's application to plead the proposal appropriately will find three advocates.</seg>
<seg id="768">This is the case with two counterparts in the original program that summarizes Stefan Haller: "if we believe the decision, we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum-old assessment tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority of Forensic Medicine (Rätte medicinalverket) has started performing tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, Migrationsverket 6.880 has been sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "probably 18 years old or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "may be under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constant during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to The Local magazine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years old or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet inquired 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institut, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they usually went through puberty sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "" "" "Reinhold Echt, head of construction at the Road Engineering Department and Transport in the Government Presidency of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitating bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach now has a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge-cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a rim attachment, which is also used as a mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20 metre wide bridge should be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of cables through the construction work in Lauterbach requires a special feeling of intuition.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting antennas in the direction of Schramberg traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher Valley entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three bridge alloys are 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the District Day of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle is inviting Rondell to the "large election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="934">And known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and vice-president Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD but demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally the town picnic was planned under the slogan "All at a table" at the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondelle - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD-Event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful image that is offered.</seg>
<seg id="939">And what Christa Karoli, Chair of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, is really happy: "it's great how many people have come together here."</seg>
<seg id="940">There is music and lots of food, including a "ancient potato salad, which could easily eat the AfD," says the woman who brought him along.</seg>
<seg id="941">The police ordered a lot of police officers to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.</seg>
<seg id="942">How did AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he strives for such an event and received the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked for a cancellation at first, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirche there are not enough parking spaces available.</seg>
<seg id="945">"" "" "" "now the Rondelle, Hompes is pleased that" "" "" "" "we can have such a beautiful event here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "he says:" "" "" "" "this is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="947">This also does: at around 8pm a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle, provides various speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-chairman Uwe lad.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch talking about their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD-Event lasts, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is shortly after 21 o'clock to tidy up.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can move away - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs batches.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if after all we know currently, a health hazard is practically excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clarifier is not really perceived by the German Minister of Agriculture?</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Nevertheless my house has been disconnected without delay and since the announcement of Germany's disappearance in close contact with the authorities of the countries.</seg>
<seg id="1100">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all information and risk assessment are available for consumers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1101">Trade has just as well as producers care to ensure that the products sold are roadworthy and harmless to health.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If eggs have exceeded the maximum value of 0.005mg / kg, they are not busible.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unloaded eggs can however be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time, not the factories are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to the current state of knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.</seg>
<seg id="1107">On the contrary, they have to expect economic damage based on presumed illegal practices of service companies.</seg>
<seg id="1108">As always there is too little control in case of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Is it only missing at the personnel or on the coherent competence?</seg>
<seg id="1110">It was just the official controls that have uncovered the process.</seg>
<seg id="1111">The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Precisely because of this, a consequent clarification of such events and handover to the public prosecutors in the cases in which offences can be present are of decisive importance.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the soccer rules affect Neymars moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not bother Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to beat teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid €222 million (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose in order to sign Neymar and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich host family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they have to deal with legitimate income sources, which allow them the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player thought that clubs, who had enormous debt in their pursuit of success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year opening period running until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Despite the fact that Platini has fallen in popularity from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin will continue to deter him from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we'll definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the flow rates for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 44,4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 paved the way for the PSG ProntoSIL with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarist enterprise could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not have to be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by Qatar's Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made over payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassadors, and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators will be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signature will increase by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best soccer players, and she tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear fall of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and it has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "Wenger said on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1157">It is very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay because there are different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country. "</seg>
<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new chimney supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is rewriting the job.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white chillboards of up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider estimates the volume of orders according to "North West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a shot manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss since 2006, the Swiss chocolates will distribute chocolate tablets on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">For two and a half years, Swiss introduced the cooperation with Chocolat Frey for two and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights the customers of First Class are spoiled by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to wet Hot American Summer and "COMRADE Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV turned), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise, it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained a original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By dividing themselves to the core of the gag - middle aged actors play horny children who grow up - yet they managed to win back the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody Goes more after the gable figure principle, among them a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that shakes the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character shoots through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dirie's underlippings of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could preheat this franchise like a repeating "Seven Up!" series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang as she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"COMRADE Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as a director, gives the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some beautiful flags for watching (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensure a decent game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "COMRADE Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it is getting there, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"COMRADE Detective," who was edited on a smaller length could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can do everything for forage.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike on drugs mafia in the country</seg>

<seg id="1213">15 accused of age between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">The officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time in Italy, two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore presumably shipped to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016, the Attorney General has established Constance against organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investigators of the Kripo Rottweil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS United Kingdom announced that preexpositional prophylaxis taken before the sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Head Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," during the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposition prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep reduces the HIV transmission in the case of infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to taking intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, appropriate participants will be identified, who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender individuals and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is £10 million and NHS United Kingdom signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, aimed at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not subject to a negotiating with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust said, "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "now that the prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "" "" "now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that they will contribute to a step closer to the dissemination of HIV in society." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced itself from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne forgot to add storage space and an mezzanine to make full use of the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to overlap two rooms, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window looks down from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moutain lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a little engineering art went inside," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is counterweight, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate-empire Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton-Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">One court file says that this means Colin has ownership of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and by both parties held lawyers law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to share their property with their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "" "" "Paul says" "" "" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "" "" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried taming trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the candidate Trump was angry about an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter Habits under control according to six former election campaign officers insisted that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets without their interventions have even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his colleagues managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisers to supply doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they originate from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article of Gotnews, the web site of Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has spoken false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House General, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and to document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most wanted criminals get post from Europol</seg>
<seg id="1419">Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be asked and hoped for.</seg>
<seg id="1420">The police all over Europe send mail to dangerous criminals during this summer (virtual) postcards.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Since the addresses of the chosen heavy criminals are naturally not known, information from the population will be hoped and requested.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Europol reported on Friday the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar of winter.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The experiences could have shown that many fleets hide at vacation destinations, called Europol.</seg>
<seg id="1424">21 postcards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times has been viewed.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues generated by the local tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious seekers at the house back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Men's alb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The former Hotel Birkenhof has been a building plot container before the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were pulled out, blankets were broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is actually a nice place," "" "" "" "says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should become "beautiful bourgeois" later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing himself.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already managed talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1475">He reckons just under one million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outdoor spaces are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace is built, which is open to the public by the restaurant.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Jury Sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the panel took up work over the past few weeks," "" "" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "" "" "wrote on appeal to people familiar with the matter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper wrote the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already preliminary charges of the Gremidium in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between the Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men should stand who acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Reportedly Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trumps in private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Several weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special issuer Trump personally moved into the centre and investigating whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Yurys are therefore also called the dressing-chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">In most cases, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to charge individuals under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, pre-charges were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former election leader Paul Manafort, were involved in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the enrollment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>

<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme gives the democrats a chance to "feel good," because they have nothing else to talk about. "</seg>

<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rash, accusations against Trump have become noisy, he did not want to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump urged him to set up investigations against the former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special educator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether or not Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent exporter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later recalled president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the special issuer could not be dismissed so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has loosened from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">That was shared by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The big colossus of about 1 trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres is now driving northwards and will probably need two, three years, until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest iron giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research information, to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeie so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disrupted the balance of growth and breaking a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scrap is broken down there, writes AWI researchers Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen C Schelfeis is in danger as well, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice the water as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice sheet leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for observing Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it's a natural happening and we don't know any direct connection to climate change, the Eisschild is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is arguing whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will continue to grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the polar farms in the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the District Day opened 41 new jobs in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are apparently very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the seats that were to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">We are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "the administration should work out a concept for recruiting and developing personnel according to the wishes of the parties." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers but to counteract future-oriented application shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient internally and externally, show concrete measures for newcomers and involve a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is from a real" "" "" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was a lazy surprise already in the crayday, when he publicly questioned the costs of personnel costs and startled the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be verified that permit exit from the communal employers "association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we don't get to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county government should strive for a house tariff in cooperation with the county-related cities," "" "" "" "nations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are now exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher tier that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone for NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis was warning a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can judge all the accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'youth rescue', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew adopts inflatable migrants, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the file of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of observing the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to overboard an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, the Nobel Prize winner organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In recent weeks, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the Minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine wicker bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy trials and attractions for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer climbs, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the lookout point at the lookout point, connected by "flew" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of being sweating through the stadium raids in wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal alliances that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The start was the VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Federation in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could far more often be present on these markets than to send the Federal Republic of Germany to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football-simulation FIFA contested at the competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, Liège has long established itself in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobosy has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in the classic sport - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and quick responsiveness are needed.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But the robbery also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport lacked.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high inclusive effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the consulting services Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts the e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little bit less against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the move.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSport competition offerer Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is also a lot happening in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a classroom, she says.</seg>

<seg id="1654">It's about keeping the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," says Dutt.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most publicized cartoon draftsmen, his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughter," "" "" "" "there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">Following stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to the end of the 60's: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artists were inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish mordium figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still on the drawing table, working daily for almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plushes and clocks continue to find a lot of dissemination around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousandler as a counterpart.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatens climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-borne bugs, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions can cause major headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaiss, an expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because in recent years the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil does not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant-ears with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped minor, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The killing of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodocice usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make Mexico's chaos dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break-off from violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodocice, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the odocice building. two Reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smile with glasses or his typical pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killers associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In the case of Riodocice, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are discomforting, and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the reason, we distrust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodocice in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot dead on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodocice, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, they assumed power members bought every copy of the issue as soon as she was delivered to the newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country to its own security, following the seizure of another newspaper published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined with five colleagues for the founding of Riodocice and sold 50 US-Dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodocice, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in Persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have to take over the task you consider as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoz team misses Valdez, the spaßbird, who like a docking worker, could curse the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask," "" "" "" "Is his love for a routine his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoz Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">No cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where the staff from Riodocice met for safety training. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodocice in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has cocked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditure concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter experienced from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the ruling institutionalist revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we used to know what happened," "" "" "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "" "" "" "" because of his slender body. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing down on walking paths and buildings in organized protests "SOS Press."</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her fury has violated objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media coverage group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones sit next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana did by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a leading article on the title page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their native states or even from the country.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition has astonished researchers that describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk as he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by cardinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a screening technique known as a counterfatting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now shown at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and borealopelta markimchelli named Mark Mitchell after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor across his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the tapestry is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure were hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable to loot, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including his conserved bowel to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea where he sunk on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The time of chalk was a time when huge diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-toned heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the undersea funeral of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the front door still covers bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Preserved remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing reminiscent is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which already will most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You must also have bought it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic evaluation will then appear with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and the booked seat Y has taken.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to poor mood in the compartment or greater room and delays in the control of one's own tickets and the artist at the end takes the time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, "Whose Streets" documents reveal the surprising personal aspects of Ferr's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone outlines the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme can hardly be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, as well as the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be exactly planned on the grounds on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>

<seg id="2125">There are many faces in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after being publicly known as a secret report on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable analogy).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering president, who was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Due to the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data might look like, a sharp, though some intellectual commentary not only lead to the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie where Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned mice became unequal briphews, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>

<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is even now at the opening of the exhibition something low and strong, as Donald Trump conducts a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flames the rigid divisions that he should fix.</seg>

<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides based on the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological aspects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, 0. 0 Memories, is also visible.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who were searched for suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday the arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A communal warning system issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigate the pens as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been a associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Ersecretary wanted to measure happiness in your e-commerce-start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - fraudulently.</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups to provide employees anonymity and complaint-hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow the C-Suite managers to bypass and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Ersecretary said she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a heat card of the company, which at a glance shows which units have the most discomfort and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment, in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Services could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial-technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">A client has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent company lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats his employees poorly or behaves inethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company Convercent uses, problems that have previously been hidden by executives, who were sitting in offices in cities or states, can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practicality.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, "Quinlan said.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittery secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies are running well. companies operate well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks associates after your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you are not following, ask yourself," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated staff, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually lengthened its days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 o'clock in order to meet the already packed time plans of the players.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a slip-hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Mainl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He went through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape gardeners, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only got the full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards representing what possessed: "you could think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch struggling to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all of it! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English story, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patcher that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was represented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed quite merry to always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men quench their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to promote landfall. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>

<seg id="2326">At the end of August there will be a festival on Grafenwerth Island as the highlight of the campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pension plans and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in YAS were in number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government reins the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">According to Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were removed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who were allegedly involved in the attempted coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan referred to the overthrow attempt as a "gift of God," as he had the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But has Erdogan really put the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Unease in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifested in the abolition of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the big reinforcements in the army and the security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In the middle of July Erdogan ordered another 7395 government taxes, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed like Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly regarded as the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the worldly state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan specifically promoted an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" within a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after purges.</seg>
<seg id="2364">"" "" "" "the management structures and operational capabilities are" "" "" "" "weakened" "" "" "", "say Nato diplomats." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for the Green Card</seg>
<seg id="2366">There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.</seg>
<seg id="2367">It intends to reduce legal migrants to €50,000 a year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this law will reduce poverty, save wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are dealt green cards." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.</seg>
<seg id="2372">This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Ministries want to rehabilitate route for road shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, over the past few months, it has been argued about the future of the race agency - now it is going to be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the railway line on which the tourist train runs is scheduled to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race for the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction works will start in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and sane the road Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this especially for tourism," said State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country will take 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, will currently be finalised, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia train as operators are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "thus the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," "" "" "" "said Sühl." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the racer-Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the course of a pilot plant in the past few months, it has been tested if the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The route is also very belligerent in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "" "" "said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt his robot accordingly to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a step-ford-woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as good as possible," "" "" "" "warms the website of True Companion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She has her moods over the course of the day - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "" "" "in mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one walks a step on Frigid (called here: resisting) Farrah, disturbing one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its site True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumerism.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not oddly or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boiled to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn-out bodies and the stuffed eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not really women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trash wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US voters have polarized must also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horrors of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all say to us all to let our filter bubbles pop.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone familiar with it, including the republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but in another context it is noticeable that this entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "Trump," we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his babies will no longer be repulsed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightful long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York carousel's carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and the climate-changing music conveys this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage in fact - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage matters not - it is a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologous while I was tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius relocated to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, suffered a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appease this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it was too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="2459">As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-door-eagles from Fhats and Epfenhofen were discharged into the holidays and in the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening, school manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eagle who grows in the chicken farm, but then dismissed in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">To do this, the mlower Schar performed a musical with the title "Der Adler in the chicken farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it hatch away from his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken sweeping a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it struck, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Goddles, the cylinders bearing the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young-animal is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His purpose was to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She desired each quartet to feel accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">There followed thanks to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who always jumps back in classroom petting, and the parents of the parents.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The time of chick is now over, declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="2477">She only divorced her students after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally, they have been able to rely on the four-door-eagles.</seg>
<seg id="2479">At the end of the day, all students made a song of summer time and holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="2480">In doing so, great joy broke out among the children.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Eight first ledgers are already registered for the new school year.</seg>
<seg id="2482">Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camp in Greece</seg>
<seg id="2483">Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece, divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.</seg>
<seg id="2484">In the morning of August 1, a group of illegal refugees were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">On the same day, they were released, while an investigation is underway.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, considerable fines.</seg>
<seg id="2488">Controls are continued throughout the season.</seg>
<seg id="2489">The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, who had been accommodated separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells were found, but they lacked mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were treated in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were obtained by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said:" "" "" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2637">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this must not be true at all," "" "" "" "an SPD election campaign sighs when the new hiobsban reaches the party centre on Friday morning." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, President of the Social Democratic Party of Lower Saxony, is standing after the overcoming of the green deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere started with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, no more, the comrades soothed at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This was done - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into staggering, the Düsseldorf-Pleite hauled the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades were struggling again in the weeks after that.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next gravure.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the context of crisis communication, he made pretty much everything wrong, which can be done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for quite some time now.</seg>

<seg id="2655">Despite this, or perhaps precisely why, in recent weeks, Weil has always tried to set accents in the band.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained uncovered by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him alone, because they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could happen.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In doing so, Weil is not guilty on the party-internal coercion of the lower-Saxon Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Mr Schulz is not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">For the time being, comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger is directed to the Greens, and here especially to the apostate parliamentarians in Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic, as Ms. Twesten puts her own career over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs. Twesten was not elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but by the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party, thus the lower-Saxon deputies continued.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns to its mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEC City Development Ministry announced on Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the event, Schindler has again given a review of what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been some sentient refurbishment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the total assets.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the sanitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The present renovations are a "success object" for Schindler. finally, it is important to also promote interior development, not only to tap into new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a sanitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total assets amounted to 833 333 Euros, of which 500 000 came from the country, the rest of the municipality sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a sanitation area created?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will further investigate Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial boundaries could be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the STEC represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalization of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is per property, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then finally be set out as a charter.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, it would only be possible to take stock of the inventory in the framework of those involved in the restructuring area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the order decision should be carried out as far as possible so that the renovations can be started next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every commune had to carry out the said preliminary examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating and deciding when to evaluate the city's grievances when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will even come back to sensations and make a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Rainbow" which, among other things, is concerned with the structural condition and the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the gray questionnaire, the "budgetary and housing," information about the size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating bow" can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler realises that the distribution of funds is working according to the "greyhound principle" - who first comes first, admonishes first.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that has highlighted the American manufacturing last month costs tax payers according to the information provided by the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht of Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval engineer for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3: 00 p.m. and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight departing from the White House should be delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the recordings made available, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate and propagated efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not accommodate budgeting for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said the company had outweighed the future of investments at the Tollcross site.</seg>

<seg id="2855">GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga likes to regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">In their pursuit of Neymar, Paris, Saint-Germain, will not pursue after it has issued an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record raid?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out to the outside, although a source near the Catalans Board indicates that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburg-based Domspatzen report on the abuse incidents relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann believes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg-based Domspatzen provides further discussions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are a church," declared after publication from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger were expressing their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Tour "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticized the fact that in the reporting of violence in the Domspans, "double standards" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but striking is the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria from Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and that's a devout fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "she also pointed out that" "" "" "" "stripes had been a normal educational means" "" "" "" "in her youth" "" "" "" "to be done with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports of abuse, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Absolutely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memory band "My brother of the pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take shelter from Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg to the Enlightenment lawyer, Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domjtiles.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be noted that R. In many cases, Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, despite violence, have even had positive memories associated with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg-based Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of victims of violence against protectants at the Domspatzen provides a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist that was palpable to the fuller when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, know about it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, in which he worked, was perceived as literally "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also outlines a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "competent," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always surrounded by children of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to acute outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't just bang with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also gave ear-figs and too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself gave himself a few years ago, deeply regrets and excuses for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods in the period of question, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely disseminated among parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually deals with in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the non-violence at the preschool, these are Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One already asks oneself if it is not more of his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working zealously at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg-based Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also involved in the final report any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother," said one of those affected, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in the context of the abuse incidents?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective culprit.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd to assume that all of it... Buben have opened intrusive or clearer or more, than against their parents, boarding schools, confidant teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their environment had been entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contrary crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "violent eating" was read at the Regensburg-based Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the "Wegener" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This is, in turn, a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clear separation: between the primary school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were really squared and maladjusted, and were dreadful, all met at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, like most witnesses, the theme of "primary school" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims" estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, despite violence, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation remains to have been taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported on the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Was Georg Ratzinger consistently joining the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "he points out this," "" "" "" "that in the pre-school he will continue to practice the punishment punishment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press release, he received an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us is still aware of.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate that the persons concerned might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test sentence was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past according to modern moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and not for what has been broken down in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally done." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take shelter from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punish, that is to say to the ear and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger play with you in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of a test sentence also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, recounts from his perspective, since the Domspatzen only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I was by no means concealing that he carried a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone one does not make a big singer and before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-winding.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during talks with her book?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and warm-hearted people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his embarking, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspicians are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look at and adore them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that you reproach him are education methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can be glad that we have long overcome this time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "for the report, which was just published, relieves him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no-one would know the Regensburg-based Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
