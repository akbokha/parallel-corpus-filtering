&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; shock@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girl@@ friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his way to combine with his family was to always cook us , prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of debate .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or I get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather snow@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is the &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with a lo@@ cker@@ el de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger worked with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they were hunting for for@@ age in a quick gal@@ lop .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and then the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended again .
on Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses .
he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
in the context of a small g@@ ala , the German sports aid handed over the golden sport pyramid to the man of An@@ hausen .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the Queen of Britain has already ad@@ mi@@ red him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the young generation for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25@@ ,000 euros equal .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US @-@ Master Champion was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ Driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Price went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s All about the Money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump do want .
however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is based on a fundamental , more philosophi@@ cal difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , in doubt , wants to keep it small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claim@@ ing Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ ay regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes are increased for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton said almost immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate is even announc@@ ing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical team of the Republi@@ cans .
on Tr@@ ump , there could be party internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent .
Tr@@ ump is planning to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ it@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the USA from the international trade , but just to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better then , calls for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump in this question wants to do is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him , so the budget defic@@ it would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ sed .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ is@@ ses the little one .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised dwell@@ ings for single @-@ min@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the women &apos;s help in Munich .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women other reasons for the escape were out@@ weigh@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr tells us .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that around 90 percent of women living in the Munich North are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; some of the children have certainly not been created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are acc@@ ust@@ omed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses in some common areas only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or are housed together men and women , it may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is included in the study .
how much the women feel this protection need can be seen at the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily raise a second house .
assistance physicians strike : demands for new work amp@@ ut@@ ations
representatives of the Assist@@ enz@@ atri@@ cians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor disputes in their disputes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its full Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC declared that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC management board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labor disputes that commen@@ ced at the beginning of September .
the disputes have led to the fact that assistance physicians strike six times this year , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proc@@ laim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ gold Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ elling and he spar@@ ed little heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s bright and sustainable Cool showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was fur@@ ious .
Putin ruled and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building Vet@@ r@@ auen will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erd@@ og@@ an he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been depri@@ ved of his office during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are picked up again .
they count towards a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television projected more cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ dem@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it looks at its reaction to the tried to take power as a weak answer .
to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the bar@@ gain pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West .
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
for Moscow , this is a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents announced at the press conference that they had not even stopped the issue .
the president of Turkey failed deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when the NATO member dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing at Nat@@ West will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor @-@ brand as well as to the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer lead to its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
on Friday , the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on pre@@ dil@@ ection trained by John G@@ os@@ den on his local track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who was on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori welcomes the jubil@@ ation when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career plans
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won over 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British fla@@ w@@ less race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournament win , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his dou@@ b@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he wants to continue in competitions up to the age of 50 .
Russian Putin fires chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ OV was many years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the narrow@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Putin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a dep@@ uty since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s emb@@ assy .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it is called ( in Russian ) that later he was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his appointment said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this moment .
but the official claim that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time want to guide Russian environmental policy , met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - proc@@ laim@@ ing posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been the Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ OV accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the German Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of ten@@ ure would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he struck producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination last month at the Los Angeles series .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al on Thursday .
on the set , there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , followed by a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and I put in my heart blood the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28th September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be about 75 fish around San@@ da@@ ale that were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectac@@ le hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge Conn@@ ected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closing of the &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 metric tons .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown today visited the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck now gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the road .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very sensitive activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
because the toler@@ ances on which the team is working are tiny - on each side they em@@ bed only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI b@@ ail@@ out station hit the Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without life@@ jacket .
they all came abo@@ ard the Co@@ ast@@ al rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have good luck and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but the boat loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has wo@@ ken today about these men .
badly injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Harb@@ urg with a knife .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ li@@ zed perpet@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when he came to the apartment , he wo@@ ke up twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and at the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building cheap apartments between Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put much stronger in the future in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD will propose to the next council meeting a &quot; living concept . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the SPD , Christoph Brat@@ mann , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great contro@@ vers@@ y in the town hall is , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do we deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is as viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to provide investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
not@@ with@@ standing this , as Brat@@ mann said , there was a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of other approximately 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , pending ties from the city should now be purchased .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting apartments back to pricing .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
for at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten is running in the western city .
around 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one removes themselves from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go on board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
what does not mean , however , that no compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time on star@@ ing on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade by many .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and recently limited to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mut@@ ually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones out and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; tra@@ pped . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursued 3@@ 5,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of following people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , sp@@ rang from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data to increase performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ usive .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them .
three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also storms of the game , which always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smart phone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
on the basis of Poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s gymn@@ as@@ tics
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on entire line .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old tur@@ ner@@ in climb@@ ed on Thursday to the championship title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es is sculp@@ ting on the floating beam during the solo exhibition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey had ended at that moment .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final check in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won gold and silver during the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark on the f@@ are@@ well party of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical ru@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school out@@ break in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition for a competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly guided by two turns , the image mur@@ mu@@ red .
floating Bar and Flo@@ ors - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them soft@@ ly when they expected her final taste - pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her clou@@ d@@ iness , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass murder during music hearing in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks since a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard distributed the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ect used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ app@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .

a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also issued a police report about the shooting , which took place half an hour before triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial k@@ iller .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Mic@@ zep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
wher@@ eu@@ pon I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her has been told that under certain circumstances Ed@@ mund can never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can help with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought about for &quot; Please sing me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on her own .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis any more for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful r@@ ash for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand@@ still on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the South of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened to floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood trucks , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service had deser@@ ted that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while still it ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near B@@ aton Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river close to Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to record a record level over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ b regions near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that an up@@ side floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only flow slowly over the tro@@ dden rivers into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still got people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step @-@ by @-@ step , who lives near , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife , Hans@@ ford , said that in the 48 years she lived there , she never had seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they had been housed until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was significantly more balanced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed away by the floo@@ ds .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to floo@@ ds and sand@@ bags were provided for the inhabitants to take along , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses will be reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; punched by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police told us that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents pointed out that Brown had suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital .
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ ra@@ ged by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I just can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical condition , shot dead , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investig@@ ating whether it could be among the injured men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for storm ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , crow@@ ned the scene of the crime .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were H@@ ül@@ sen .
so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia , Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and police reports , according to reports , report@@ edly reviewed the video surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross trainer at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than a reason .
first of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ m@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this kind of sports , but we do not see gymn@@ astic classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in weal@@ thy suburbs which can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of her athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to provide a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training .
I founded my sports foundation 20 years ago .
at my events we offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban adolescents ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by h@@ ating the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
general practitioners would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 resident doctors who voted for election rejected it .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had un@@ vei@@ led plans to for@@ ci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS could be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be det@@ ri@@ mental .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at times of aw@@ ful times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair of the BM@@ A Committee of Assistance Der@@ mat@@ ologists , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have still considered serious concerns to the proposed deal , in particular that it will fuel the current availability of the occupancy and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by discussions met with the government on opposition and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just made over the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointment , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting doctors on the pi@@ cket line cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work amp@@ ut@@ ations do not reach anything but over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the Committee of the Regist@@ rar and responded favor@@ ably to the health ministry as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es to address the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , the Health Education GB and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form coverings .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow until the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots tri@@ ggers , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 month capture of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Mechan@@ ism Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill proposes no treatment that goes beyond this period of time .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture makes electoral fraud blo@@ om in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed from office last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report on corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread ignor@@ ing of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of abuse of rage due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption @-@ king , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set up lock@@ ers outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should take a reference to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes non @-@ removable ink to apply to a person &apos;s finger when giving up their vote to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only a campaign against electoral fraud , but should also protect the local government from the wider corruption and fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral calendar in eastern London .
last year , a special election court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor of Lut@@ ry was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of dec@@ eit all over the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the conduct of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says , &quot; As a proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... public institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists edit envel@@ opes to stop &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
perform systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists are working on complete let@@ ter@@ heads and envel@@ opes from post@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give the police power to set up lock@@ outs for poll@@ ing stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law that facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Human Rights Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the workers generally asser@@ t that vot@@ ers go alone in the bal@@ lot box .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropol@@ itan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; check@@ ups &quot; of the electoral register of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country we@@ ars a proud legacy as the Mother of Parliament , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , out of the br@@ ink and band that has proved to be an impressive double @-@ se@@ ater of the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ischer is by far not the only ath@@ l@@ ete in order to have gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one may believe in the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British wide @-@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina , with her big expressive eyes , is supposed to be a double @-@ winner for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool , South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theater
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American called Nathan Adrian of fans to resem@@ ble a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons include K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and their smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile resem@@ bling the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float threw &quot; like a low &quot; and died during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m breast@@ feeding aff@@ el .
Mac@@ Donald , who was caught on board in the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more color , could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the link , baby . &quot;
too excited she went down like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swimming pool Ai Y@@ an@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible for the Canadi@@ ans to open the gap to China .

Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m breast@@ feeding aff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many made him speak
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # n@@ ailed .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy formulation , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times for people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC informed and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on air and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relates to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to exc@@ use me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming in the C@@ BC Olympic Turn , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of float and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark swe@@ ars by woman trying to under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled off her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked out how she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf again .
she continued to browse and sam@@ pl@@ ed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a couple of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to go back and out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone - or think about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to withdraw the clothes from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple and find out that another woman had her and und@@ ressed herself and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapon attack with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the gun between your for@@ ech@@ arm and your shoulder before be@@ ating it with your free el@@ bow .
beat it with your knee in the bar and twist while the aggres@@ sor cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist them so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker to your chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and direc@@ ting the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is most secure to transfer your money unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ uts for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went a serious test by his immune system and the Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex - in that he ta@@ sted some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scrat@@ ched his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dish@@ washing head on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the det@@ achment of each object he used a lumin@@ osity to show himself and to show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to lick the sink of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to stations up to dish@@ washing up of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film , he responded to his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to de@@ em after their lumin@@ osity value was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not check here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we launched crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dance them and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent stated that they are at least occasionally using products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social family destroyed prior to del@@ tification of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a social family left their social housing after a del@@ usion with a damage of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighb@@ ors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being viol@@ ently removed from her property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were perfor@@ ated , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , ru@@ bb@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been rel@@ oc@@ ated and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for Corn@@ wall Housing management , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inf@@ lic@@ ted by the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all bats , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ des and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn
neighb@@ ors said they had to fight them on the street and to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall Housing ordered them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ usion was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighb@@ ors who said that their lives were made to hell .
one said , &quot; They were not afraid of anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said it would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house g@@ arbage and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since a del@@ usion is always the final step taken into account of Corn@@ wall Housing .
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighb@@ ors had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighb@@ ors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ing on the ground .
workers of the property management will now have to remove g@@ arbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as weighing , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after it was found guilty of ownership of a drug of class B in trade pay@@ point .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will be a les@@ see who does not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told me that the del@@ usion was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a striking military jet flies to the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ tive P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane of the Air Force put an incredible dive
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was present
this was the moment in which sc@@ ared tourists start to panic after a light jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle gear , without first seeing what came through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the air@@ plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deeply flo@@ cked
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility of the area around the area , the air@@ forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was endangered .
space fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which restricted his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

after the game , gold and silver medals were staged with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had really strug@@ gl@@ ed with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma was not the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking ball@@ ads were to be seen .
M@@ iz@@ ut@@ ani won the play of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the white @-@ rus@@ hing had a ri@@ b injury in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , after that he had to be satisfied with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump induc@@ es ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now reported weakness of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary vo@@ iced such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside the republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media scene again .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ ere from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were indiffer@@ ent to the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
even Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the sender CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does nothing else than to &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be OK , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans will be stronger for Congress .
Olympia : tri@@ ster sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
the I@@ OC wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
after an attempt at a Dop@@ ing check in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former Sprinter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test at the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the Team@@ lead Ken@@ yan by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the I@@ OC to investigate the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the I@@ OC , the IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , gave the rehear@@ sal and signed it , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who stood on the list for the training checks of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Vice @-@ President Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed Ath@@ letes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport .
for some time now , Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing attempts at the I@@ OC .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks laid out by the I@@ OC before the Rio Games , an unusual warning was made that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently challenged a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport has been extensively and systematically de@@ filed in this kind of sport .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic f@@ ond , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ aks Bern@@ st@@ eins &quot; master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a childhood dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ ol@@ y to her with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have been Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; Bart@@ oli laughs .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same topics , and they are as significant as they were at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London scho@@ ol@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British scho@@ ol@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after having left the war @-@ torn country and returning to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Ju@@ dge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman from Rei@@ d later said that he had@@ n &apos;t talked to Clinton yet whether it would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s team would not provide trouble with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ e@@ ys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
tre@@ ats aims to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to present a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U MUS@@ ES calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys differs since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the calendar as well .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the cal@@ end@@ ars .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish congregation reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dial@@ ogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany reck@@ ons at short notice with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , even &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the harsh treatment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with hundreds of thousands of seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; Welt &quot; of Friday .
because the government had over@@ taken Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal off@@ ences many months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the vain put@@ sch there are still sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in the Alban@@ ian cities .
Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the pressure on the remaining cur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group leader demanded that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria is positioned against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand of fire as Gü@@ len charm destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dial@@ ogue and Education , the World .
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognised because of political persecution .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and thus almost 29 per cent of all eligible for asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey there is no struggle against war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum Rights According to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so from the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s no more stupid than hi@@ ther@@ to : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election war@@ ri@@ ors , are on holiday .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals but are not allowed to choose the Parliament .
there are practical problems : in the holidays hel@@ pers , posters hang out , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count on the end of votes , only ru@@ b lab@@ ori@@ ously .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make election campaign short of the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ning .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary spokes@@ man Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will presum@@ ably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to make major expl@@ or@@ ations ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ co@@ ders , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that in the country you have to take the base away , that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly anything in the sides of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , Socialists and Democrats last more than 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD gained a clear victory at 35.@@ 6 percent in front of CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their vac@@ ations and lay their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; the president of the country , Claudia Müller .
otherwise green champ@@ ions embar@@ k on a search for local vot@@ ers among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ els with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything rather z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site was rel@@ oc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the mutual benefit of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now continue on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the road to escap@@ ing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant dis@@ comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chief Executive Vice President Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking and rather familiar with their navigation device than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ cing in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community increased the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself well informed on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been las@@ hed .
the quick@@ est was traveling with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become more cal@@ mer .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue losses in them lets anyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the de@@ aler@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; maximum slight drop , &quot; but also conc@@ edes that , of course , &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot;
the most heavily tra@@ pped are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only it , but all the restaurants have hit hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates revenue losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map has thrown his farm back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dism@@ issed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt , on request from G@@ öh@@ ner , asked if there could be financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts where such a bit more generous was handled .
with all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests miss less frequently due to the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t go here , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his master cli@@ mates return to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , it &apos;s brutal .
it is constantly being bol@@ ted in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a d@@ oom status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the con@@ cili@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
and I also took part in it .
but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the results and at a &quot; realis@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Co@@ alition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère enjoyed a little time before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère establishes a second attempt for proposals not to be done with the SPD so far : he wants to place sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still holds this for reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything at all , which in the coalition partner anyway has no chance .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have in themselves : he plans fast processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country are intended to check their smartphones and dis@@ close social media accounts for security checks beforehand .
at D@@ ul@@ ungen for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is political and legally sacred .
some of them also work un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that were pro@@ found@@ ly employed by people could not be cl@@ asp@@ ed even during election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are competitions .
with the issue of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Chief of the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he does not think of a departure from the double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to resur@@ rec@@ t it is not sensible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package at all corners is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is quite a lot of things to fight .
but the SPD is also trying to gain security in the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals carefully and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the distribution numbers worldwide increase .
but it is not running in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen will start sales in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to demonstrate a plus in spite of its many brands and well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year &apos;s month with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany bag@@ ged deliveries by almost one sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the we@@ aker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been given a purchase restra@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the United States , where the exhaust @-@ gas atmosphere first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected family @-@ brand of Lower Saxony is further lightly sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a distribution of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales figure from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas testing software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
according to the conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after the conversion of the car , the car manufacturer put out a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place as a result of retro@@ fitting and all of the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ le sc@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regimes as it was called .
for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich savers in future prosecution - as second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or daily payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September , Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund is calling for this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or Daily Money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs in future will cost 400 euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he has be@@ held 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and account for 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for each million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ u@@ ter principle , the cost is now further reduced .
leaving the cash simply in the v@@ aults of Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I do not want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank Chief .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federation of co@@ oper@@ atives said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are alone to bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with tri@@ bun@@ als for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay the fees for deposits nation@@ wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria , which comp@@ ute a compensation for private customers deposits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German National Bank and Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken ( BV@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to compete .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged love records .
before you make ha@@ ste to comment on the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gro Men &apos;s Middle Ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multilingual retri@@ eval of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to a mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in S@@ oho , wearing a modest gray suit and wil@@ der before I stay , keep my hands and say something better like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of S@@ oh@@ os is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were once located - still there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate speci@@ als .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ g@@ ow , 55 I wrote by Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) in Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things that I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70@@ ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
that is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who heard about the com@@ eback and have caused them to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually dischar@@ ged their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of fans of record audi@@ tors of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers started the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that wake up happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or pos@@ sessions of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ ps from a stack of records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I da@@ zz@@ led through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead @-@ record , so that I can put them on a shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ blown , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who only come in slowly .
mo@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it makes a window @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee rather than a big one .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to sample the je@@ ans @-@ hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Polar@@ oid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of S@@ oh@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my inquiries showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record stores in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums can &apos;t be considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who stands out over the shoulders of nothing remin@@ is@@ cent of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects quotation for demo@@ li@@ tion of businesses in the Jung@@ le Refu@@ ge@@ e Camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in Cal@@ ais &apos;s jungle , in which thousands of refugees live to settle down .
during a trial this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be authorized to sell 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops where persons inside the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture ar@@ gues that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which offer a fire and sanitary risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people operating the 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops , but that the concerns of Cal@@ ais Pre@@ f@@ ecture were absolutely understandable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people living in the Jung@@ le ager was over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic Time Trial , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin didn &apos;t want to make himself enter@@ tained .
&quot; I keep on keeping the World Cup in view , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Jan@@ eiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; said Martin .
he must analyze in peace which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the FIFA World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed over the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games transm@@ issions
watching other people while playing video games is a huge success - Microsoft wants to benefit from this too .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can aband@@ on missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Gam@@ er@@ ese Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the employees of the start @-@ ups , which has hi@@ ther@@ to served in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i rus@@ hed .
this means that the tak@@ eover has nothing to change for the customers .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ wit@@ ch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ wit@@ ch was bought by the online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .
YouTube gaming belongs to the Google @-@ Mother alphab@@ et .
here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the temp@@ o founders are to be particularly effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement Trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehab@@ ilit@@ ating bridges with temporary hur@@ d@@ les , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary heater for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days in continuous measurement , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access pro@@ hibitions by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
it is possible to move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer h@@ itch in the high @-@ frequency state .
as a result , it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also a gun @-@ safe outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the camera from v@@ and@@ alism .
according to information from Vit@@ ronic , the trailer has been tested in different federal states since 2015 and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ star rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stepp@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ up , and raw power to win gold - its first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to it in the fin@@ als .
but independently of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ ry and j@@ umped the attacks of G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series @-@ winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ro@@ de in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a stock@@ y T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores .
and so it is .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ ussi@@ an , whose fans sang , flags wave and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ ff rang out , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and the GB bent in crus@@ hing beat in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated a semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain forced South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the work to the front in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and sc@@ ored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight against the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ one gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve going into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they called for the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ 37 un@@ defeated deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trium@@ ph@@ al .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental adv@@ ancements that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer , who didn &apos;t know about 30 months before he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make some rab@@ bits .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose network &quot; V@@ eit@@ enstein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; exemplary in Bavaria . &quot;
a small drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was said to have been in the original sound of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia def@@ ended the purpose @-@ association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enz Group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband associate , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility of the V@@ eit@@ enz Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further towns and municipalities , there are water supply contracts .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert M@@ öller was hired as a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband since 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the pipeline construction and maintenance work about office and organization activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always taken new additions , because water is the most important food for life and drinking water .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , Gö@@ ll@@ ers praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers for a faithful and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of passion for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association and he lived regul@@ atively the water @-@ purpose @-@ association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enz Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
he received a lot of praise and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller sang water@@ beds Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful man .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well building and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe demo@@ li@@ tion at the high tank near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at one time can only be maintained , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility was handed over to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship Attack in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man sho@@ ots on a life @-@ threatening woman
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock and killed her mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. must call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ine or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims , but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing spindle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional cost in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from green electricity production , are from the table .
it remains at the Liber@@ ation of the Renew@@ able Energy Policy in the existing facilities for the so @-@ called egg production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to use the gas from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own power generation .
in this way , the status qu@@ o of the previous regulation was largely determined .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment goals are to be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation was exac@@ erb@@ ated by China being the world &apos;s largest producer of steel on the world market in view of the we@@ aker domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw price d@@ umping into Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a bit .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have an impact , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is uncle@@ ar how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp finally did not want to exclude locking of individual works .
in the German steel industry , about 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Federation announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the crowd returned to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been below the previous year &apos;s figure by two percent .
the Association anticip@@ ates an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , Spirit , Health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree programme she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and altogether more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be ar@@ du@@ ous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly ask their lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff as quickly as possible in everyday life .
when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Association of the sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their youth .
through song texts and especially melodies , even people with dementia can be avoided at long rec@@ umbent events .
in singing , a particular achievement is required for the head , explained L@@ enz .
at the same time concentr@@ ating on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting himself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone do not just focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the chor@@ us , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens when there &apos;s a sound next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a retirement choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
a lot of senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
everyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive than cats to cri@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the calling of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ das also did not let the males grow cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat bab@@ ys in the eyes of the little ones .
they react ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ st@@ ling of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or of importance , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cat cri@@ es was different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
nine adult boys and eight females were observed from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a reputation of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of he@@ avier k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally up@@ lifted .
despite the low sample , the researchers consider their results to be meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet own offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned swi@@ ft@@ ly to the loudspeaker when the calls of the very much @-@ reg@@ ained k@@ itt@@ ens were playing .

Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no stop even before the football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , the South Coast living in America has now been accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is said to be a trailer of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the state of emergency has been suspended for 90 days until October , in fact , this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared its end on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponents of the Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what the face of the Turks but faced with dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
in the case of Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will come back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he sc@@ ored the 1 : 0 victory lap .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory finale .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; say goo@@ db@@ ye to the Europa League too early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shield @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the time of the coup attempt at the AC Florence and at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the Gom@@ ez was announced only after the attempted coup attempt to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it would have to be ready to aband@@ on approximately one third of the annual salary estimated to 7.5 million Euros , &quot; Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals opportunities at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ line was closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed herself shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ acci@@ d and extended at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ ry scene : with a sm@@ iling smile she was still standing in the hall and prov@@ oked her show .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a storm .
but there are still numerous other sport@@ s@@ men going to the Rio Olympics in spite of dop@@ ing past .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European championships was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the catch and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two world champ@@ ions over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .

this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete has seen so many medals in retrosp@@ ect .
in 2005 , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after having established testosterone dop@@ ing .
in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give up Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
he also reg@@ ained the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a verdi@@ ct of the International Sports Court of CAS .

Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ error in Thailand - injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it again .
she planned her return journey at the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , it is still uncle@@ ar .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday evening in a b@@ out quarter .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning there were again two sets of explo@@ sives , a further man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach beach of Pat@@ ong , which is popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives launched in a flo@@ wer@@ bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g demanded several injuries on the south @-@ west coast as well as in ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast .
one goes out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said army gener@@ als DAN@@ AI K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives , but it is probably the action of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islam@@ ist rebel@@ lion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that bom@@ bs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received secret instructions on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still uncle@@ ar which group is stuck behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force the security surrounding important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not judge themselves against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office advis@@ es on his homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and Sur@@ ro@@ undings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after con@@ front@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , travel will not be sub@@ du@@ ed in these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday passed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to sc@@ orn ha@@ vo@@ c while the country moved towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , took power , re@@ tains itself good to bring the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the constitu@@ ents in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Executive Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ essen of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ essen said that his authority was closely coordinated with the regional offices during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Legal Director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with Pop music .
the Islam@@ ists act as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an embarrass@@ ing advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly pr@@ one to attack .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ essen said that he has no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with regard to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ici@@ ans said that in this context he would not yet speak of new right terrorism .
but in recent years we have established that there can be anti @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the groups so far had emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern about the fact that many enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ments went into the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying thing .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodations were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that had previously been politically indiffer@@ ent , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD and lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised the right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ le becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic games or world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could no longer see in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ r@@ te became the viral agent afterwards .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is being distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
since most sport@@ s@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ t just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hal@@ e . &quot;
in reference to a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run for media attention was attended by the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to go on alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old then had to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the threatening election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if the election to the US president has nothing to do , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be OK , Tr@@ ump said .
he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post goes into trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
from the coming year , the Post will also want to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been exam@@ ining whether they are to be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with which letters and packages are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ der had said there will always be ques@@ tioning , about by crafts@@ men .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step toward 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership steps down after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company G@@ f@@ K exchanges his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ cuts came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K fores@@ h@@ inted that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group , G@@ f@@ K : once again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ign@@ ation of the company management , the global number Five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
the G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the G@@ f@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already been dischar@@ ged from the supervisory body with effect from 12 September .
as of September 1 , the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger transferred the Executive Board to the Executive Board , distributed the company .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; Board Spe@@ aker &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
as a reason for the return , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation .
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still uncle@@ ar who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders last the dis@@ appointment was great over the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not visible even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K business figures , any shareholders will be rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would make the odds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company did not have the chance to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales contrac@@ ted by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the company &apos;s decreased value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company value depreciation of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , resulted in a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the G@@ f@@ K achieved a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( County of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to avoid an opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by the spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance vehicles and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the provin@@ cial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry drivers and potential witnesses to sign up with the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wast@@ ewater will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Pu@@ ig@@ h 3,@@ 44 wast@@ ewater treatment instead of 2.@@ 10 euros up to now ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( hi@@ ther@@ to 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( hi@@ ther@@ to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that for these se@@ wage installations under covers run up .
due to legal grounds , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ covering manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ lim@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as General Manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater treatment of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period can be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ cious increases in fees based Schmidt explained that in all three se@@ wage plants it was possible to handle relatively small installations with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , due to their age , renovation and repair expenditure did not last very much in all three facilities due to their age .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the W@@ ast@@ ewater Unit of Az@@ endorf .
in the Pump@@ werk World Bank the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first se@@ wage pond had to be removed , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance costs and maintenance costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water attack in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to this , Schmidt , the market community of large maintenance costs in wast@@ ewater facilities , has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater utility could not be extended by these facilities because it concerns sanitary facilities .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , posted as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , prices of the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices stayed as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is cri@@ tici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ oss@@ essed , property @-@ sp@@ inning tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day .
all ab@@ norm@@ alities get to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tici@@ zed criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and so@@ gg@@ y che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es lead to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful stere@@ otypes .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and un@@ pleas@@ antly said . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not le@@ ak @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreci@@ ating extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ b@@ ulation wire .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference spaces to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counter@@ parts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others decided to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for media and a telephone interview she said she believes that rac@@ ist contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in recru@@ itment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and ended her ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to speak about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that took snap@@ shots largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures about the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence services , re@@ jects Congress Committee
military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the armed forces , intelligence services and military budget comment@@ ators reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command intelligence analy@@ st , who reported how su@@ peri@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short of Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically ab@@ duc@@ ted by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com agencies , regularly reported a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , established .
the guiding errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts saw the pressure from their su@@ peri@@ ors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s tips altered the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that anal@@ ysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Insp@@ ector General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force &apos;s conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence ass@@ essments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compens@@ ated the moral among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ es@@ sively little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no evidence of having found evidence of a White House &apos;s intervention in Cent@@ com &apos;s anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Insp@@ ector , which was taken up after complaints from Cent@@ com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the Insp@@ ector General are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also announced that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts may sometimes have di@@ verg@@ ent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the accus@@ ations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is remin@@ is@@ cent of the divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of those who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are alike in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place in their group of six teams .
the first one will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman out of the way that will lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday may start , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey stick in hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work gap in London that we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back hand@@ shake from the local area .
India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team turned out surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball about the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and imm@@ ac@@ ulate the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the ra@@ ids of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro seem to feel constant and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast relay of competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning bar , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV commerci@@ als , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may reign for a long time .
but if I can turn out arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on the trampoline had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived in the past 16 years that many of them , I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who managed it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm , partly because it fits for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending jump - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ edge and salad ) before they land on their feet .
according to official Olympic program , they are assessed according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ round athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go on in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the top and down@@ wards on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also a further cave goal in the broadcast of the television : the world or the Olympic @-@ cord .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel as ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space of this .
the v@@ ector of the amp is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she j@@ umped down , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back upwards .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant raising of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualifying and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon , at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time streaming ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymn@@ asts suggests , according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his new fan base .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across violent resistance by the government .
witnesses testi@@ fied that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with polic@@ emen during shooting .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses testi@@ fied that police officers shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks while forcing them to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive as much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or j@@ ail , killed or driven into the vast wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have other options besides prot@@ esting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ sera , a lectur@@ er in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
one generation protests .
there are numerous dis@@ comforts that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less in recent years , can use the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of an@@ kles under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were gathered in such a way as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ aci@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ h@@ aci@@ as , who are mainly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ e@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ h@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively in@@ transparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested that according to the statements of anal@@ ysts they apparently were stolen by the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of ri@@ ots went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal affairs of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ res@@ ian city , from Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West is definitely willing to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim to have founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take refuge in the event of an event@@ ful phase , into the peculi@@ ar position of declar@@ ing statements which he could not even have meant .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump gave back to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to imp@@ ly that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate would not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism sett@@ les down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bor@@ ed .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised when he thought the Russi@@ ans should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s E@@ mails , but he later declared &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then return as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction drops . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive sound , since its conversion values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is more focused in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ oked his loyal co @-@ workers to face him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , most prominent advoc@@ ates , had great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ ream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it aggres@@ sively in the Middle East .
in front of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once driven by the market price , café is back in Green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were driven out of Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
soap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business , launched in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people mour@@ ned as the last loss in a v@@ aul@@ ting city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel , and ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York is changing , it is also re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alised Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , previously lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave up the coffee a while , she said .
&quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went to work there and inevitably always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no anger over the fact that the soap store took the old business room .
in fact , the owners of soap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for bre@@ w with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to issue her soon so that his new neighb@@ ors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt insi@@ sted that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ecom@@ ing .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the U.S. while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a rep@@ orter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , wireless I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate .
when the rep@@ orter presented h@@ amm@@ ers , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male rock workers and it was served fresh baked p@@ ies for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; marked the road with which the country was about to be no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e gi@@ fted why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods , such as bre@@ ads and asser@@ ts , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted that coo@@ ks could hide in@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury .
peculi@@ ar mixtures were tried out , as a rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy eating .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women , &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carr@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s l@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude , are tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million man of the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to have an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the hi@@ rel@@ ing of a hou@@ se@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt explained that the White House produced the most boring eating in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates were swe@@ pt away at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the dessert wine dessert , which was eaten by President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody t@@ anned something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ines , brown Gli@@ bber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E succe@@ eds in three times .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ther he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to the image paper , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life to the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Guard , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a bright symbol@@ ism in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I &apos;m dying to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria in a video .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image rec@@ ites its last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Shi@@ p S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ y only got offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
but this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is true that the evolution@@ ist biolog@@ ist has long assumed that Greenland will become a stone age .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s hair is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely popul@@ ated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers have little knowledge about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of Greenland .
her slow motion eng@@ ul@@ fed them when they took six animals with a transmitter from S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
prey do these shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver , that tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timeter measures .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the contained proteins are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had consp@@ ic@@ uous carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons seeking greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon degra@@ ded into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons trials , so it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
in its enti@@ re@@ ty , all the larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication of obviously have at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
the low temperatures often also affect the organism of the living animals that live there .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist biolog@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
in recent meetings , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board adopted the communication by mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clari@@ fying the property , plot and development issues and the applications for sur@@ ve@@ ying , the sale of land in residential areas &quot; Street lane &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , volunteers will be able to report immediately in the town hall , the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to make inquiries to settle further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n area , the designated commercial area is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been admitted to the United Kingdom so far .
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EI@@ O@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is a big fund industry , it cuts as well as Dublin &apos;s infrastructure deteri@@ or@@ ating .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
the city also features readily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer business consultancy , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris on 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W conclu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
in London , according to figures from the Hel@@ aba Landes@@ bank at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry worked in London , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent li@@ tigation with Mer@@ ck
a US Secretary ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an US judge discovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , US National Ju@@ dge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to exemp@@ t the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained mut@@ ually and claimed possession on laboratory work , which So@@ stain@@ bu@@ vi@@ r was based on , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday said .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters that have buried themselves within the city , are currently under@@ mining the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians , who were held as host@@ ages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan informed Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , which was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are just clearing up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , resulting in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ ars ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years .
they paid an effective German tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ tors with reference to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have stated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax audit by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign hero Ian SA@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax insp@@ ections were not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , among others the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal to ask questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business model and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton ki@@ cked off on the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump requests his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump had paid no or very little tax in the 1990s for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times c@@ ited on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors , who stated that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump got &quot; fear &quot; before the elect@@ or@@ ate and not in front of the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published its tax return back to 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 clin@@ tons showed that it related to USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike the majority of Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues amounted to USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already had the idea for years , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is world telecommunic@@ ation day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the elephant &apos;s lighting with a tor@@ ch and the bu@@ bbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom fl@@ aked with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust of chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a breath quite usually already enough to chase the elephant .
one last possibility is a ver@@ fer who sho@@ ots a gold disc into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
town council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ osk on St. Go@@ planetary Rhine
normally , the St. Go@@ planetary investment projects of commercial companies with K@@ us@@ h@@ edge apply - yet the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly out@@ dated .
however , the municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or refused to apply for the new construction of a sales chair on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons in construction .
&quot; basically we welcome new tra@@ ders , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk will not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish Director defe@@ ats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not have any Israeli pre @-@ selection , as Arab guests would have called for an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director looked at the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix be cleared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany , Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have followed the inv@@ itations of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue .
the hotel promptly rejected any alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung c@@ ited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
add that the country code has been added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to intervene rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals of the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls spray against the pro@@ visional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the most recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambass@@ ad@@ ors shared .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent versus the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan continues this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued about 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 countries in terms of number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses searched : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been committed to the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ mi@@ red their faces from the beverage market employees demanded the removal of cash and then fled at first to foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money has been captured , the police don &apos;t divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly visible .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have to be p@@ lowed by the silver @-@ colored car in the opposite of the car park entrance , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the Social Ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny of Nag@@ old with their assist@@ ants on their summer vacation in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quar@@ tered during the first week of school holidays in the quiet area of the Frei@@ zei@@ thei@@ m Hard@@ t@@ wäl@@ der .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the p@@ etting zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims for the Door of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stri@@ es from the oral care unit , E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in presum@@ ably two years , the Sec@@ retariat of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a several @-@ day pilgri@@ m walk .
various pilgrimage objectives have been tested and they finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Mu@@ enster University of Freiburg on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , arose .
in the evening , past@@ or Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and shared the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from H@@ orb , we drove by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Münster &apos;s beloved wife and so the pilgri@@ m route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were surrounded by a short pulse with different prayers , songs and scrip@@ tures in the morning and evening .
but also on the way , the mines on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always went to R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgri@@ m songs .
for the overnight stays the parish church of the local par@@ ishes was available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of the stage targets for a tasty and also strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after this , the stage was taken to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at first we had to desc@@ end some 500 metres in high heat and then climb@@ ed again .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage in Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau Met@@ ropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to H@@ orb .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ g@@ ow assumed the anchor role , which his coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the young man made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after having only a modest sixth place in London in March at the train world championships in London , despite the appearance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow it to be Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climb@@ ed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ g@@ ow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell to the train .
he returned that statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a supreme victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y it is possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic Gold Med@@ als in a competition .
that would be Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger ban@@ ni@@ ster born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be like that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next to the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated as a Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ year @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
world record , which won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought with evidence before the qualification yesterday when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women competition , continued tomorrow and ended , Laura trot@@ ted out , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is rel@@ ying on its strong team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a winning stre@@ ak of medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there were drama in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and fashion pen@@ alties as well as the retirement of S@@ izes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt stream of Port@@ land as a result of rising energy demand
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake because the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby raise all supply agreements , as the supplying energy company was issu@@ ing .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy issued for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance , as the melting shop uses about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with his Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting facility , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a termination .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; is not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that in 2010 , it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
anal@@ ysts warned due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the anal@@ ysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Thom@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year and around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue
Kendall J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US V@@ ogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this verse to we@@ eping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a cre@@ pped reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show biz and producers ) , as she forgot the cover of her sister and ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ y story of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this publi@@ city somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes her , as for the V@@ ogue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold out of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a , the 8@@ 32 pages of the radio are 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years , images of the magazine were still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in the past few years , there were clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ e &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga got the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ised the mi@@ st@@ mi@@ ties of the moment .
these feelings co@@ iled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but walking around on the m@@ ess seems to pass by at the point .
San Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue .
she is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seeing in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centers assign 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s most auxiliary services are rejected each year by the municipal procurement centres , while the industry is facing the impact of further central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ usions and similar situations - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ utilized , are prepared for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the municipal history centres of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centres revealed that thousands of people had already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without a postpon@@ ement of the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who for@@ sake violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families going through divisions , workers who have been dism@@ issed un@@ just@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in need of assistance from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Chancellor of Justice as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipalities and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n accused after Staff allegedly drag@@ ged weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that their campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to a cow@@ or@@ ker as they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte &apos;s State Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i agreed to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i received his charge .
after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired for damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val was elected Hill@@ ary Clinton and judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign realized that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for body injury and permanent mental damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s press officer Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip did likewise fail .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
respon@@ ding to calls at his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both German states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD cut off from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the pol@@ l , the party was just barely ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent before ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD in the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties only rose to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the contrary , miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : first Smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to shops exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet era .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in Western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received via fax , the communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even accessing web pages was possible via HTML browsers , though slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates vend@@ ors , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
to be online anytime and anywhere , that is everyday for many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple , alone 5@@ 55 million units were sold .
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these include the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the Smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the night vision .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry had to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff at Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces@@ hips left alone , creating 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s enlargement is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bla@@ zing on the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie in@@ correctly at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question posed to him .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn to we@@ ary growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is backed up by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will be one as well .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse Play &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software producers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; will be the same .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block adverti@@ sements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding with regard to its adverti@@ sements to make it difficult to detect sign@@ aling information about which part of the advertising page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o battle between the flag@@ ging open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of scor@@ iers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ r@@ ying scor@@ iers have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe use around 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks .
since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , the company shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so that Facebook is a worthwhile investment for such a step .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would be an &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook maintained that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b tool , which is why we concentrated on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of people .
woman driving on Swiss highway with presum@@ ed suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down on the road in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who urge them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report themselves .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a coll@@ ision avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the motorway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent pot@@ tery , after crossing a man and killing one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court .
the Court found that the police officer -- who had responded to a call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once was inhabit@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and guard against quick ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a Sun that was 30 percent we@@ aker .
&quot; in the ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed the sun &apos;s side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that had previously been suspected by planet researchers .
although it was suppos@@ edly habit@@ able , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen depri@@ ved itself only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a little co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly coordinated with the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ ö@@ lar@@ bei@@ ans start discussions again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep a few full day sessions in the coming weeks starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group short@@ ened the rates to its trac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating will follow a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ swing .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a@@ integration with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and in which context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these stir@@ ring stars em@@ it large amounts of star win@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than a few massive stars .
re@@ pull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotating slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare satisfactory qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much to know about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star emerg@@ es
the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional recall , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ star all @-@ star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant in the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a coach and coach in the future - with a full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez returned with power for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es several mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eb@@ alls &apos; hall of fame .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was on the field , so controversial his appearance outside the space .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted to have forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a legal dispute the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez then said sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his part@@ ing days also didn &apos;t go sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; said Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy for the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen , Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , Li@@ fting Li@@ fting Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an athle@@ tic ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre barrier @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the unknown .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king drug for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the CAS International Court of Sports confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the fo@@ oth@@ ills over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news spread about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went with it himself into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV broad@@ c@@ aster B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should be an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent in the banned substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal was also expected to be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov contacted the ath@@ l@@ ete immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Federation had forbidden the whole Russian team to start until an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , even the stag@@ nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sports , the earlier off@@ ences in China also caused violent cl@@ ashes between athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ tour@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang pl@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of an examination with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; he said .
sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ id@@ ine in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but only had to sit down for a three month period .
data enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent pol@@ l of malware rep@@ atri@@ ate specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the solvents demanded by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the pollut@@ ant software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rat@@ ors discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money , mostly in the form of bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currencies .
but where private users find the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production still stands .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of German companies reported reported turnover losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely break up business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay not , you only promote the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rat@@ ors &apos; demand in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure security researchers examined the usage areas and contact with black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors actually attempt to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files .
and if private individuals are saved after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negoti@@ ate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware was created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ ma@@ iler then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per registered computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als are deleg@@ ating sp@@ amm@@ ers to dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the P@@ FS survey rely on the ability to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful harv@@ esting , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors rather thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the damage potential is a much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Fal@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top has a slight effect .
HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
it is not only available in a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for raised back@@ rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a little qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top @-@ tested &quot; Executive &quot; top variant .
the security systems include the City Emergency Brake Ass@@ ist ( working at speeds 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; while man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ring .

airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed that liability is only concei@@ vable in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical for aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken the knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general life risk , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of sickness : when the organiz@@ er pays
after their trip , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of her Turkish holiday .
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a defective se@@ wage treatment that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was in the opinion that the trip was thus defective - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not hurt his duty of information , so judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ious one another - is one of the general risks of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 sick .
in July , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and determined at the same time to respond to terrorist threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence perpet@@ rat@@ ors with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , but increase security and also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapons are am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet becomes more difficult .
the recently widely deb@@ ated duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to remain safegu@@ ar@@ ded according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said , with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister holds a better social support .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior shar@@ ply opposed abst@@ en@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Spar@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of constitutional law , a general prohibition of full @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment is problematic .
you can &apos;t ban everything you refuse and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
green leader Simone Peter designed the minister to simul@@ ate t@@ act and action with new anti @-@ terrorism packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet PRO@@ VER@@ BS and a ti@@ ghtening of the right of residence bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ ems regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car sk@@ iers who are in traffic in traffic on the ambient road every evening when they drive over the motorway ) Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer roads and Wes@@ eler Straße .
drivers can then jump right from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided at an early stage , thereby improving the total sequence of operations on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road @-@ track nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder brakes the drivers most of all between 17 and 19 .
on week@@ days , the back door is enough to reach the bridge across the Alber@@ t@@ onian way and sometimes even beyond .
this is why the needle &apos;s eye is on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic is directed only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to take the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane .
the responsible state enterprise cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related traffic jam will last .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official remaining time up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal reserve , the state enterprise deliberately chose the less traffic time during the school holidays because it is to be reck@@ oned with han@@ di@@ caps .
traffic will be on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ enster within the framework of this project .
most of the yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ astic , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language im@@ part@@ ing are planned .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was poor@@ ly suited for clouds and rain to observe the spectac@@ le spectac@@ le , said the chair@@ woman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star sc@@ olls are Per@@ si@@ ans , which with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips for Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter Wo@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a distur@@ b@@ ance and a distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep .
right through the sleep many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly frequent with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and possibly starts to shake over everyday problems and wor@@ ries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , be@@ ware .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary Sle@@ eping Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should contact the general practitioner first , advis@@ es the shooting .
it can be clari@@ fied with tests whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory physicians , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing plac@@ ements , in case of abnormal li@@ vel@@ iness , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after sh@@ ov@@ eling , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling paints the sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
fire is counting on : regular sleeping and standing times , not lying too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and this is quite and not con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed themselves on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he had taken gold for the first time at the short @-@ track World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team mates standing in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € premium and a jungle of 15@@ 0,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the conveyor system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look as accurately as possible in the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say the controls are to be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported to the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first launch .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; demands the choice ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop .
airport : Ban@@ de det@@ ained by luggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police made the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bag and luggage ste@@ els as ban@@ dage .
at 9 : 30 pm , civil servants recognised a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the police from the past th@@ ef@@ ts of theft .
since mid July this year , the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acies and participated in a collaborative , labour @-@ intensive and very professional manner .
the specialists of the crime commission@@ er 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had entered Germany in order to pay criminal off@@ ences .
in the process , they had captured over 15@@ ,000 euros in total .
old buildings , some of the Lin@@ den@@ bä@@ um@@ chen , in between still another co@@ bb@@ le@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like at first sight , but the police number it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden .
on the façade of a gray house , someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a tough action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolling three weeks of official declar@@ ations , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers followed the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of Sp@@ ät@@ i .
there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who pre@@ fers three children here , are mostly gener@@ alized by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to fight for a majority of police protection against the v@@ andal @-@ making lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between occup@@ ants and their neighb@@ ors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all of the Main@@ zer Street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under a large police station in a down@@ right battle , many of the projects in the Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied before 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and vot@@ ers from all over the world over the past few years : people from East Germany and former home occup@@ ants now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by disc@@ ar@@ ded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury judge statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes do not cause damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented apartment for 17 years in a rented house , can &apos;t speak of in@@ security .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighb@@ ors who have not been destined to do so .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the ri@@ gs anymore .
for the architect , her street is no criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained .
this is why it was also so important that local residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ builds in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well gor@@ ged are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the people who are angry about color bom@@ bs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who runs should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub neighborhood to compl@@ ain badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Refu@@ ge@@ e Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Ped@@ agog@@ ine assi@@ sts the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the urgent Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
thus , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job .
looking for an administrative field with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , an apprenti@@ ce Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not her central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job for a limited period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde , that Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ e- and full @-@ time players .
there are big and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the washing machine
it has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the provision of connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Council Office to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de fac@@ to does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , so one should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be emp@@ tied as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be installed in the car street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm place of residence there are intern@@ ships , apprenti@@ ces@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and remedi@@ al activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reported .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive overall effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , says Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here we also jump into administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and don &apos;t be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
a difficult question : are they afraid of radic@@ alisation after the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s client clearly states that &quot; what some are nai@@ ve to name . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely inv@@ oked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look out for activities on site and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
the policy is afraid to answer this question clearly .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher have already been utilized to integrate the previous human beings in a reasonable way .
