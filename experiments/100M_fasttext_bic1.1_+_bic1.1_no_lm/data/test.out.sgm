<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer worked with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they were hunting for forage in a quick gallop.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the equestrian career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the context of a small gala, the German sports aid handed over the golden sport pyramid to the man of Anhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of Britain has already admired him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid.</seg>

<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US-Master Champion was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the hand-baller Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's All about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump do want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump, in doubt, wants to keep it small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will massively repay regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes are increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in that must be invested, Trump and Clinton said almost immediately." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical team of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump, there could be party internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump is planning to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewables with its investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpitfish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both do not want to isolate the USA from the international trade, but just to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump in this question wants to do is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him, so the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised dwellings for single-mined women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the women's help in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-gold Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smelling and he spared little heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's bright and sustainable Cool showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin ruled and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding Vetrauen will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdoggan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been deprived of his office during a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are picked up again.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television projected more cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as it looks at its reaction to the tried to take power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the ongoing resentment on the bargain pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not even stopped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey failed deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is called (in Russian) that later he was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "his appointment said to Putin:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at one time want to guide Russian environmental policy, met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - proclaiming posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the German Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of tenure would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closing of the "ceiling blowers" approaching each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 metric tons.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck now gets a Betonguss for the Deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the extension, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the road.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the tolerances on which the team is working are tiny - on each side they embed only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD will propose to the next council meeting a "living concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it's about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the president of the SPD, Christoph Bratmann, said:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU wants to provide investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding this, as Bratmann said, there was a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of other approximately 1300 favorable apartments, whose funding will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, pending ties from the city should now be purchased.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about getting apartments back to pricing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing corporations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one removes themselves from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time on staring on screens, was complained in the last decade by many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones out and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "trapped."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursued 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of following people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, sprang from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take "take 30 minutes of time" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day," because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elusive.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also storms of the game, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smart phone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the basis of Poker's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on entire line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old turnerin climbed on Thursday to the championship title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles is sculpting on the floating beam during the solo exhibition of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey had ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final check in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after having won gold and silver during the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical rubling passport - is matched to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school outbreak in the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has no longer lost a competition for a competition, a winning series that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was slightly guided by two turns, the image murmured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating Bar and Floors - in which Biles holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them softly when they expected her final taste - pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her cloudiness, she threw the audience to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="26">I haven't asked for the prognosis any more for a long time, because I don't expect it to really tell me someone.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency standstill on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the South of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened to floods after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood trucks, boats and sandbags were increasing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that alone the community of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service had deserted that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while still it rained in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite river close to Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to record a record level over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburb regions near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that an upside flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only flow slowly over the trodden rivers into the Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still got people from the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson, were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another step-by-step, who lives near, would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "" "" "said Hansford." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years she lived there, she never had seen such a high level of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been housed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flooding had spread rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer reported in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground was significantly more balanced since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and street floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWL CBS subsidiary reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tangipahoa.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches which were both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed away by the floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once the water starts to return, they will return to their homes again," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the community of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to floods and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take along, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the last big flood we had was in March," "" "" "" "said Lacy Landrum from city administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to become a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it still rained on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his statements, a handful of houses will be reported to be flooded on Thursday, but on Friday they were not reported.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "punched by balls," survived shooting in Philadelphia</seg>
<seg id="2">The police told us that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents pointed out that Brown had suffered several shot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and belly, but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he has done a lot, his small body was enraged by bullets," he shared his grandmother Delores Melendez to the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe that.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The family of the boy told the broadcaster that he is likely to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He would have started the first class at a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in a stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, shot dead, reports the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether it could be among the injured men of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a crossfire between several archers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cartridge sleeves for storm rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, crowned the scene of the crime.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this kind of sports, but we do not see gymnastic classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts come primarily in private gymnastics maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide a more affordable and easy-to-access exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban adolescents (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by hating the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">General practitioners would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted for election rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt's plans had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS could be found in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay for the employees and patients would be detrimental.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at times of awful times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee of Assistance Dermatologists, announced last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have still considered serious concerns to the proposed deal, in particular that it will fuel the current availability of the occupancy and treat it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions met with the government on opposition and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls which form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the blood flow until the heart and causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots triggers, it can flow through the bloodstream and clogged the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month capture of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Mechanism Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. the draft bill proposes no treatment that goes beyond this period of time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutry Rahman was removed from office last year on the dismissal of a government report on corruption.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread ignoring of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of abuse of rage due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption-king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set up lockers outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a reference to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes non-removable ink to apply to a person's finger when giving up their vote to prevent someone to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not only a campaign against electoral fraud, but should also protect the local government from the wider corruption and fraud culture associated with it," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral calendar in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court ruled that the reigning mayor of Lutry was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>

<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of deceit all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed in particular alarming the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the conduct of evidence to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says, "As a proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="23">The report considered by Theresa May also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>

<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your forecharm and your shoulder before beating it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat it with your knee in the bar and twist while the aggressor crooked before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist them so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Attacker to your chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test by his immune system and the Würgereflex - in that he tasted some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scratched his course on a Euro ticket, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a dishwashing head on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the detachment of each object he used a luminosity to show himself and to show us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the sink of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to stations up to dishwashing up of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he responded to his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample screed showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to deem after their luminosity value was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We launched crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dance them and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent stated that they are at least occasionally using products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A social family left their social housing after a delusion with a damage of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being violently removed from her property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were perforated, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been relocated and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing management, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflicted by the family, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strides and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and to call the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing ordered them and their partners this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delusion was cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said, "They were not afraid of anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this morning we couldn't sleep." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, since a delusion is always the final step taken into account of Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deling on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the property management will now have to remove garbage mountains, which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70g of cannabis as well as weighing, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after it was found guilty of ownership of a drug of class B in trade paypoint.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that she will be a lessee who does not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told me that the delusion was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproaches and those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="1">"West Side Story" Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic fond, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Leaks Bernsteins" masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a childhood dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She recalls with melancholy to her with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is clever, of course also naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is very similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have been Römerin," Bartoli laughs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an immensely generous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley's "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the same topics, and they are as significant as they were at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's no more stupid than hitherto: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election warriors, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals but are not allowed to choose the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays helpers, posters hang out, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count on the end of votes, only rub laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to make election campaign short of the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionning.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary spokesman Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "their refugee policy," "" "" "" "We create this" "" "" "" "have accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will presumably cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to make major explorations; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "" "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that," "" "" "" "cocoders, plays only a" subordinate role "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that in the country you have to take the base away, that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly anything in the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU electoral fighter is also self-revealing: "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, Socialists and Democrats last more than 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD gained a clear victory at 35.6 percent in front of CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the Parliament." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">Otherwise green champions embark on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvels with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The mutual benefit of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to setting up accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now continue on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking and rather familiar with their navigation device than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were francing in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the community increased the vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue losses in them lets anyone look through.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only it, but all the restaurants have hit hard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on request from Göhner, asked if there could be financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other districts where such a bit more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests miss less frequently due to the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go here, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his master climates return to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, it's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="22">According to the conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the conversion of the car, the car manufacturer put out a "guaranteed" certificate, but do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is juridical subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed the VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place as a result of retrofitting and all of the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Volkswagen itself does not use the term" "" "" "" "warranty" "" "" "" "as it was called in corporate travel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, half a year after the conversion, customers can come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in customer interest, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage, which has nothing to do with the gassle scandal, it comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regimes as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">For this reason, VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you make haste to comment on the pseudonym non-Allegro Men's Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multilingual retrieval of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to a midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wilder before I stay, keep my hands and say something better like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were once located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55 I wrote by Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and ready.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things that I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who heard about the comeback and have caused them to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually discharged their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of record auditors of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that wake up happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "an employee flips from a stack of records." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I dazzled through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead-record, so that I can put them on a shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-blown, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I have no record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz drills out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detect if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window-bumblebee rather than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to sample the jeans-hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my inquiries showed that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums can't be considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebee-shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who stands out over the shoulders of nothing reminiscent of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in Calais's jungle, in which thousands of refugees live to settle down.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 makeshift shops where persons inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture argues that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which offer a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 makeshift shops, but that the concerns of Calais Prefecture were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-star rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis on Thursday evening when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line-up, and raw power to win gold - its first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - at least a Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to marry and jumped the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series-winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau rode in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A stocky Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua toured Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Seeinussian, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff rang out, the Fijis hugged and the GB bent in crushing beat in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated a semi-final with 20-5 and Britain forced South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the work to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they called for the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.37 undefeated deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advancements that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer, who didn't know about 30 months before he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>

<seg id="2">The managing director of the water-purpose network "Veitenstein Group," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "exemplary in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was said to have been in the original sound of Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband associate, of which 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility of the Veitenz Group, located in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For further towns and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Möller was hired as a waterman in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband since 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the pipeline construction and maintenance work about office and organization activities, the budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always taken new additions, because water is the most important food for life and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, Göllers praised Göllers for a faithful and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of passion for his water-purpose-association and he lived regulatively the water-purpose-association, as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenz Group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a lot of praise and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller sang waterbeds Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful man.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well building and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe demolition at the high tank near Kirchlouder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn at one time can only be maintained, because one filled the high container from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional cost in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from green electricity production, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the Liberation of the Renewable Energy Policy in the existing facilities for the so-called egg production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to use the gas from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own power generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation was largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation was exacerbated by China being the world's largest producer of steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw price dumping into Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a bit.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have an impact, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude locking of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Federation announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the crowd returned to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's figure by two percent.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Association anticipates an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree programme she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be arduous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly ask their lungs will not get out of the puff as quickly as possible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">When it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Employment Association of the seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often linked to positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song texts and especially melodies, even people with dementia can be avoided at long recumbent events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a particular achievement is required for the head, explained Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting himself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone do not just focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the chorus, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when there's a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a retirement choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lot of senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Everyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cat cries was different with the urgency of their dependency.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were played for a reputation of little ones, taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of heavier kittens, which were additionally uplifted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the low sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who have not yet own offspring, responded to the cries," Konerding said.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned swiftly to the loudspeaker when the calls of the very much-regained kittens were playing.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her return journey at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and chumphon are also Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a bout quarter.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning there were again two sets of explosives, a further man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach beach of Patong, which is popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives launched in a flowerbed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang demanded several injuries on the south-west coast as well as in chumphon on the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army generals DANAI Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is too early to express itself to possible motives, but it is probably the action of Muslim rebels." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have received secret instructions on impending attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is stuck behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security surrounding important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but mostly they do not judge themselves against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-known bombing explosions, the Austrian Foreign Office advises on his homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday passed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to scorn havoc while the country moved towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, took power, retains itself good to bring the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could no longer see in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habrte became the viral agent afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is being distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habt just wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">In reference to a "prosperity bump," the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle, played there no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani's run for media attention was attended by the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to go on alone in a run over 100 metres of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old then had to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the sewage rate in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that for these sewage installations under covers run up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal grounds, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as industrial and industrial enterprises from Wellimahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As General Manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over- and undercover from the preceding calculation period can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The gracious increases in fees based Schmidt explained that in all three sewage plants it was possible to handle relatively small installations with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age, renovation and repair expenditure did not last very much in all three facilities due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complex in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welchahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Wastewater Unit of Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumpwerk World Bank the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be removed, the sewage sludge has to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance costs and maintenance costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticized as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blossessed, property-spinning tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All abnormalities get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have criticized criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and soggy cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowing face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies lead to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and unpleasantly said."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not leak-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tribulation wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference spaces to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such items remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and a telephone interview she said she believes that racist controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the great part of white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that took snapshots largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures about the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence services, rejects Congress Committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the armed forces, intelligence services and military budget commentators reports of great discontent under Central Command intelligence analyst, who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short of Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically abducted by high-ranking CentCom agencies, regularly reported a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, established.</seg>
<seg id="7">The guiding errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman of Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's tips altered the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the release of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "compensated the moral among analysts and" "" "" "" "gave excessively little room for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no evidence of having found evidence of a White House's intervention in Centcom's analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the Inspector General are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also announced that" "" "" "" "experts may sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the divisions of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commandlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first one will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman out of the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday may start, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back handshake from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball about the left flank, then moved to the middle and immaculate the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 leadership.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the raids of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to feel constant and inescapable, a fast relay of competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar, which is handed down from the wristwatch to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I can turn out arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on the trampoline had already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived in the past 16 years that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who managed it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm, partly because it fits for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never-ending jump - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hedge and salad) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympic program, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-round athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go on in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the top and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also a further cave goal in the broadcast of the television: the world or the Olympic-cord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space of this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the amp is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumped down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downward, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant raising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifying and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time streaming; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anaesthesia and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts suggests, according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr Dooley expected his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during clashes with policemen during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks while forcing them to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the vast wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have other options besides protesting," "" "" "" "said Seyoum Tessera, a lecturer in Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomforts that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, can use the turmoil and arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of ankles under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were gathered in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amhacias, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of time, the Amhacias, who are mainly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemeechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amhharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively intransparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested that according to the statements of analysts they apparently were stolen by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of riots went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal affairs of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amresian city, from Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is definitely willing to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim to have founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dissipate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take refuge in the event of an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements which he could not even have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump gave back to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate would not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism settles down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he later declared "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then return as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction drops." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive sound, since its conversion values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is more focused in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps joked his loyal co-workers to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps, most prominent advocates, had great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hinterbänkler, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread it aggressively in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "he mocked the" poor, miserable "" "" "" "" TV experts trying to understand him and said, "" "" "" "" You can't! "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime associate of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work in Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhay only got offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that the evolutionist biologist has long assumed that Greenland will become a stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hair is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyles of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow motion engulfed them when they took six animals with a transmitter from Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey do these sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver, that torches from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-sharks who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measures.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the contained proteins are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had conspicuous carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons seeking greater amounts of this radioactive carbon degraded into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its entirety, all the larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication of obviously have at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-wal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often also affect the organism of the living animals that live there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former president Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Redeemorars; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book about her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidency, Senator Tim KAINE from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton published his tax declarations for the past ten years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministries from the oral care unit, Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in presumably two years, the Secretariat of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a several-day pilgrim walk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage objectives have been tested and they finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Muenster University of Freiburg on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and shared the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Münster's beloved wife and so the pilgrim route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were surrounded by a short pulse with different prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the mines on field crosses, chapels or churches always went to Rast to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgrim songs.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish church of the local parishes was available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of the stage targets for a tasty and also strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After this, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at first we had to descend some 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage in Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by cooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow assumed the anchor role, which his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the young man made the legend proud when he rushed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after having only a modest sixth place in London in March at the train world championships in London, despite the appearance of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained, when they saw the potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standarround, the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow it to be Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindi admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell to the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned that statement later and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a supreme victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Hindes said," "" "" "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny it is possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day were also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger bannister born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-year-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">World record, which won gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with evidence before the qualification yesterday when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women competition, continued tomorrow and ended, Laura trotted out, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a winning streak of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and fashion penalties as well as the retirement of Sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy issued for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations -direct and indirect - could be jeopardized at closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominance, as the melting shop uses about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Melting, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of a termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the "Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" is not impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this verse to weeping," "" "" "" "wrote Kendall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), a crepped reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn's most popular show biz and producers), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ends with a classical twist: they all have a surprise party planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clichy story of nearly every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls big sister Kim likes her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold out of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that is rather similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, the 832 pages of the radio are 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine were still seeping before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the past few years, there were clearly more celebrities who moe "as" models, celebrities are "on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga got the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised the mistmities of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings coiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the mess seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">San Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CDU are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="7">According to the poll, the party was just barely ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left came to 19 percent (18.4 percent before), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me it was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprenticeships left alone, creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blazing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie incorrectly at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question posed to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk, which is backed up by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software producers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" will be the same.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post, in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday Facebook announced that its desktopside would change the coding with regard to its advertisements to make it difficult to detect signaling information about which part of the advertising page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-fro battle between the flagging open source community and the converters has already been underway since the invention of scoriers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying scoriers have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down on the road in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and guard against quick evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the ISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed the sun's side of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that had previously been suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and in which context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which emerged around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these stirring stars emit large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than a few massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Repull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare satisfactory qualities like rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much to know about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dancing shoes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, Lifting Lifting Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An athletic athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre barrier-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athletics competitions these news come to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking drug for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the CAS International Court of Sports confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, just about 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the foothills over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has applied for the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the national association takes the matter" "" "" "" "very seriously and demands full co-operation in the investigations," "" "" "" "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news spread about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went with it himself into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "she said to Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "she was innocent," "" "" "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "" "" "said the Athlete." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should be an EPO blood doping agent in the banned substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-rehearsal was also expected to be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov contacted the athlete immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "" "" "" "" we Bulgarians are under observation so many have already been excluded. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday also the case "Adrian Zielinski" was announced, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days before positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had forbidden the whole Russian team to start until an exception due to systematic doping, even the stagnation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sports, the earlier offences in China also caused violent clashes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lactourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang plelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over," said Lacourt in French radio. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of an examination with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping cheaters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested for the stimulant trimetacidine in the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit down for a three month period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data enklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent poll of malware repatriate specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvents demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the pollutant software," "" "" "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" Welt "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money, mostly in the form of bitcoin cryptocurrencies.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production still stands.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported reported turnover losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely break up business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "" "" "pay not, you only promote the problem" "" "" "", "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators' demand in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers examined the usage areas and contact with blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up free accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are saved after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski of anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware was created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailer then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per registered computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals are delegating spammers to dissemination," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the PFS survey rely on the ability to defend Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful harvesting, the perpetrators rather threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "" "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is a much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Falcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top has a slight effect.</seg>
<seg id="7">HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only available in a luggage compartment of 453 l for raised backrests and 1026 l, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a little quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top-tested "Executive" top variant.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" while manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegler responds to traffic sign recognition and throttle the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI jack lie below the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped Top-Diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up ringing no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Woeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the insomnia, therefore, is a disturbance and a disturbance of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Right through the sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly frequent with depression," "" "" "" "says Weeß." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two or three hours and possibly starts to shake over everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, beware.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is beaten, tired, unslept, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleeping Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should contact the general practitioner first, advises the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with tests whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleep laboratory physicians, for example, in snoring with breathing placements, in case of abnormal liveliness, in sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After shoveling, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling paints the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fire is counting on: regular sleeping and standing times, not lying too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and this is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler expressed themselves on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he had taken gold for the first time at the short-track World Championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now protected himself against his ex-team mates standing in the criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 €premium and a jungle of 150,000 €no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming is bad, but doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">With this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look as accurately as possible in the subject of doping or even operate it.</seg>

<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to the National Anti-Doping Agency in Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of the Düsseldorf police made the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bag and luggage steels as bandage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 pm, civil servants recognised a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport, which was known to the police from the past thefts of theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since mid July this year, the two women and two men had committed several delicacies and participated in a collaborative, labour-intensive and very professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the crime commissioner 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany in order to pay criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process, they had captured over 15,000 euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some of the Lindenbäumchen, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like at first sight, but the police number it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a Bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the façade of a gray house, someone "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new tenants will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "article about this" "" "" "" "trendy neighborhood" "" "" "", "as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a tough action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolling three weeks of official declarations, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers followed the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who prefers three children here, are mostly generalized by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to fight for a majority of police protection against the vandal-making leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer Street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under a large police station in a downright battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied before 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world over the past few years: people from East Germany and former home occupants now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by discarded slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury judge statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes do not cause damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented apartment for 17 years in a rented house, can't speak of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been destined to do so.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the rigs anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is no criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that local residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless newbuilds in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well gorged are living here," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can't approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the people who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who runs should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub neighborhood to complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be called with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Refugee Officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedagogine assists the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the urgent Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less mocking than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative field with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, an apprentice Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, "says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job for a limited period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika deuschle supports hone- and full-time players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the provision of connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Council Office to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, so one should rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be emptied as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be installed in the car street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm place of residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and remedial activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine reported.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive overall effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here we also jump into administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and don't be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are problems," "" "" "" "people with whom nothing goes." "" "" "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the most recent occurrences, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's client clearly states that "what some are naive to name." a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely invoked.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "Regine says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look out for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is afraid to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher have already been utilized to integrate the previous human beings in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
