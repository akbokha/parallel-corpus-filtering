Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress held a controversial speech that was partly considered as aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably ag@@ it@@ ated , and he said that the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb did the fatal accident at some point thereafter .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
in spring he obtained his doctor@@ ate in education .
one of the long@@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried a couple of years to teach her the guitar .
he was the s@@ warm of women back then .
all the girls f@@ used when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er said he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica game in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt were also attending the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that they have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire less workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired during the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start in this month with job interviews and the number of employees is rising from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the holidays are even months away , Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees selling , sending and delivering products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and a length of arm from being with the pr@@ incess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever fil@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chief once again calls on all parties including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly even this month , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in order to cope with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Sur@@ fac@@ tions that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks on surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims Tr@@ ump probably will win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which nobody even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Com@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and start to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps arbit@@ rar@@ ily values have been rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; angry &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; enthusias@@ tically &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers who are ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they set up their guar@@ di@@ ans , republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since then , when four out of ten end of July they put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination vs. only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ dump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , in front of Walker 15 points , in front of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump tell they have for@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say that you never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign he called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; from Mexico two months ago , immigration was the corn@@ erst@@ one of the 2016 public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump will also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high levels .
in the meantime , around half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Monday pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Ré@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - that is , the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers one square metre is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential places , however , one of the prizes is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers real estate service provider has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two times Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 52 . / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es Hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deser@@ ved at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth overall success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in the Champions League in the Champions League , Müller received a kind assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had passed a bul@@ let of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised to play in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ ly @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich recorded word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without spar@@ ing .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal category , including against famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ v@@ ent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were introduced too often by rel@@ ocation to left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ ch .
in the 6th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown struck the pole pol@@ o from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bayern were acc@@ ust@@ omed to their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to put need@@ les .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was a decree .
as he drew a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 56 . ) .
before the new , Guardi@@ ola was able to defend a four @-@ chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after mus@@ cular problems , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ ie Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ c obviously prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went on strike against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study .
good news : if you do not , the risk will decrease rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had watched over 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , empha@@ si@@ zing the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment is back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich explained from Birmingham University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking pl@@ ung@@ es the lifetime . &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and results in good dental health right down to the old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet the remains of the late anti@@ quity along the Rhein@@ u@@ fer
Arch@@ eological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for archaeological site preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists have now found it .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
apart from the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new trial in dispute over T@@ TIP
to def@@ use the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functionality corresponds to significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Mal@@ m@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de reserves the right to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is said to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should be equal parts of the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to obj@@ ection to judgement .
until now , the parties concerned themselves with each other on arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gements did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Mal@@ m@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it aims to work on an international investment judgment based on its own data .
there may , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially of major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , the company will charge damages on the tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or impose a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations like Camp@@ act received the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was particularly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economics Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Mal@@ m@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European company BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the business pi@@ anos by too many new rules .
this means that small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continued uncle@@ ar on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should already end this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly draws on the map , what his me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late 60s , but can drift in great opul@@ ently at any time .
rum@@ or arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states should be defeated .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens steps down here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nation@@ wide celebrated master@@ piece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ b@@ ord@@ ingly on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album climb@@ s into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any year &apos;s leader@@ board of influ@@ ential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then rely on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively of electronic com@@ partments .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations .
long ago the smaller clubs have emerged , the stage shows are here to the colorful spectac@@ le made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage decoration .
Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark kept Hamburg More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; which has been available since March .
even though nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens notic@@ e@@ ably more mature comes back to intim@@ acy and folk music .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one h@@ ears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; plate . &quot;
only for an enc@@ ore St@@ ev@@ ens would like to be modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally tends to be under th@@ under@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ord at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo unit .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo unit and for the first time he will join David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to post the first of his six questions shortly after noon , with the media likely to be examined by the media and closely examined by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to res@@ ide in silence during the commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during the s@@ ine of the national an@@ them , prov@@ oked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several tit@@ le@@ tide stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of Sh@@ adows ministers have refused to serve as leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acking themselves within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns declar@@ ations on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes lay ahead in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament last decade .
the Labour president who promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; skill &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ traction , and that instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s ques@@ tioning .
when it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the prime minister was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und went ab@@ rup@@ tly to data showing an increase in the UK wage growth . at the same time , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this percentage was the fastest and experienced ass@@ essments at the time of an increase in interest since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth once again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s stocks rose 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mond@@ i were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % , having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of JD Sports says higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , takes as much on the day as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vi@@ kings would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling a dream . &quot;
compulsory school ?
who does it che@@ er ?
the fans do not .
also be@@ aver does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the supermarket he cas@@ tig@@ ated three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company , many , many dollars on the be@@ aver account .
and with every doll , which looks like he and above the counter , Bi@@ eber is also assi@@ sting .
if Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one marv@@ els at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress Bi@@ eber finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato p@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and in the potato p@@ eter developed by Ol@@ denburg burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the word &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat have put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
on the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television .
since then , in his shop there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has meanwhile been adopted by the Leban@@ ese in the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
for this reason Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary understanding of the international community is also good for his customers .
Met@@ cash launches site campaign to fight Al@@ di attack
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground floor campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual Investor Relations Day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash lost market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s increases sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the debt reduction in sales and mar@@ gins at the same time .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ chil@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and ear@@ ns lou@@ der than criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; got into the spot@@ light with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka on the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison saying : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ ril and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp th@@ wart@@ ed a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ g@@ ow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite jeal@@ ous about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drag@@ ged into the conflict , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too rigor@@ ously .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take into account Kyr@@ gios in the important decision that begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ros &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick was very quick to climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency situation , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency situation and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ ver@@ ing over them , migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian support police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foreign Minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more hail from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels couldn &apos;t agree on a common immigration policy .
the ministers , however , agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ clo@@ ded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not set his hopes on a verb@@ al action from Brussels or its neighb@@ ors .
the emergency state reached on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the migrants &apos; influ@@ x of migrants after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ants were used at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck in the Middle East for many war refugees and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Viktor Or@@ ban , Prime Minister , insi@@ sted that most of the arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not prisoners of war who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia became a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted tra@@ ffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Associated Press rep@@ orters have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
the authorities are busy rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressing a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway @-@ connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved national pol@@ l
former U.S. Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face towards ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the vot@@ ers in the elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the vot@@ ers &apos; democratic vot@@ ers .
more than five months before the start of the primar@@ ies , most democratic vot@@ ers say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is what candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders posted some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 per cent of the vot@@ ers of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman becomes president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ ers will be c@@ ited as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from being .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead up to S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
thirty @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that appears to him as the &quot; elect@@ able &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ er vot@@ ers .
similarly as last month , no single Democratic candidate or a potential candidate for the vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies stands out un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in the vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies of their party .
maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him .
in general , democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies generally view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the Democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are un@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this remains a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers overall : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of vot@@ ers across the country face Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good management notes .
from the six candidates tested Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son returns to nation@@ wide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey po@@ em behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support in the new survey has fallen to the two candidates , and others lose stop dramatically .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday pol@@ l .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in &apos;s Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin of the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in poll@@ s - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to question tr@@ um@@ ps faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) has a maximum of 18 degrees .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood took brutal attacks on Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he had been charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a destination over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the impl@@ ements and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on behalf of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning by his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt force injuries .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe suggested an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of religious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise of interest comes , and the bos@@ ses fall into stag@@ nation , loans for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
thus , representatives of the US Central Bank have so fier@@ c@@ ely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a raise interest .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal levels but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a glance based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest expenses can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets profit from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a more recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on loans is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
in the present case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants took the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading accounts for only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study , all the raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put themselves in the shade after the beginning of recovery , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months so far .
fixed income was volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates a raise interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the loans fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between long and shorter bonds and leading to a defl@@ ection of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in infl@@ ation@@ ary expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all market features if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar is making its products more expensive on the global market and also financing its debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit from rising bu@@ cks outside of the pure share games .
savers could see profits from higher yields , even if experts of differ@@ ing opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives &apos; member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the channel because of its &quot; stup@@ idity . &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also c@@ ited the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ itters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also c@@ ited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far from his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and public education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn from radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf I really consider important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder work was needed to engage the public when it did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire came under fire to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million pounds .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if the next time there is a maintenance series .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales were slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expendi@@ tures in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expendi@@ tures for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG shop of the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers picked up around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites threw off .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers op@@ ted for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 out of £ 1 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in M@@ ec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funer@@ als in M@@ ec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia att@@ aches to the collapse of some of the huge Saudi @-@ bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to show their respect , when the first of the dead started their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funer@@ al proc@@ ession was passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane was pl@@ ung@@ ed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funer@@ al when the Saudi King drove a sanc@@ tion over the Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds , which were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of M@@ ec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane was over@@ thrown .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not at their disposal for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over large construction projects .
al Qa@@ eda &apos;s dec@@ eased leader , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European crafts@@ men is over
British employ more and more crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged
this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix @-@ Shops , aimed at crafts@@ men , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q will close up points nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified East European crafts@@ men who carry out their work in their home .
if you can sk@@ ill@@ fully handle walls with a hammer or a brush , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has now out@@ dated services at low prices .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open up 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at crafts@@ men and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buy decisions are made by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this to a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occup@@ ies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group cul@@ min@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice @-@ Master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and sec@@ rec@@ y on Wednesday at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt Regional Court .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted legally in May .
the current process was adj@@ our@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the def@@ end@@ ants were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 Gel@@ der von Verein@@ s@@ kon@@ ten , via which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions .
it damages the damage with approximately 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial dis@@ appearances .
this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in order to cast off in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argu@@ ed that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials only had to pay expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in whom they invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time we were confronted with the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? , &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial ministry .
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ accused he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed upon : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts .
furthermore , in case of financial success , the withdrawal of the expenses for expenses was decre@@ asing retrosp@@ ectively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , was paid out as a plus on the account .
for this reason , also l@@ ump and non @-@ detailed covers appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts held together the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the withdraw@@ als had not been dis@@ closed to the association in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial support , it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against which a functional investigation was started on account of counter@@ fei@@ ts , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he finally said he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim compensation . &quot;
why compensation ? , Ju@@ dge and At@@ tor@@ ney wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal counsel ? &quot; he asked .
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he has never related a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged EUR 1,000 per month for di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not provide accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged as being correctly judged .
kilometer money also covered the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all repairs must be made in cash , and he said in his statement that he had to travel to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank in Blei@@ burg .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the computer @-@ terri@@ fic will be able to build further jobs during the company spl@@ itting up .
the sub@@ missions of the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) will not stop .
within the scope of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce sales of 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this will save costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred as of the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard shares were 2.3 percent after the exchange .
the corporation , which has become large with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently being divided into a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales and a we@@ aker demand from corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo most recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
in this way , the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a breakdown and massive sub@@ missions on the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 5@@ 5,000 positions .
conflict : majority supports the Anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent argu@@ ed against it , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
working with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed would be 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 66@@ th IAA

after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ th International Motor Show with the motto &quot; mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ ers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA anticip@@ ate some 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent Viol@@ ence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian B@@ order
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it there was a police line forming and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ throw ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first replaced pep@@ per@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is ob@@ serving when the US central bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was last week in view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates at the current level will hold from 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed started N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ sector and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y view of global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm C@@ ET on Thursday
death cap at Delta State University left school dism@@ iss@@ al
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was sorry for the first murder and wanted to &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot at one , and killed another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told the staff of the emergency station that police must send police to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
as police tre@@ ason the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had called up relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb obtained a doctor@@ ate from Delta State University as his life law on the University &apos;s website .

all this surely demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per year for cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a board member for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of eu@@ row@@ ings with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was a complex company .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the Tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stops on this Thursday .
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the rule of rest for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as fast as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes during the past few months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pilots , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; as@@ par@@ agus concept .
in the fight against cont@@ est@@ ants , Lufthansa distri@@ butes routes to the company &apos;s own image airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outer defender to the we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be postpon@@ ed tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape from a red card and the suspension of an el@@ ective .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a collapse when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oulder by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron likes The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , op@@ ted .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , is giving a summary of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Z@@ uss was host@@ ages and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agre@@ es to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here , a so @-@ called young boy , like the local environment , h@@ ears dev@@ our@@ ing on@@ ce @-@ ler despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , slu@@ gg@@ ish being , &quot; speaking in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably had come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral calendar .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
pushing Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this before - players are their own best vot@@ ers .
long ago you could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further gro@@ c@@ eries for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son - while Nick comp@@ ton nine got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and off .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he sc@@ ored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us a lot .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making Mo@@ een alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and received four squ@@ e@@ aks , emerged and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown he &apos;s a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger , my former team mate , played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his st@@ ats - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the most nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights we can take advantage of .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ y &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ buil@@ ders do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of the UK from the EU ) could win in Zul@@ u if the economy goes into a built @-@ in device by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented new action strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n , leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought fier@@ c@@ ely on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ate said state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capit@@ als where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the over@@ power@@ ing long res@@ ins such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how common Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not have during the 1975 @-@ inspired referendum , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can feel weak in Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name for themselves as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ curing aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries most of our big newspapers possess .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ aner than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly l@@ aps on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official stance on Europe - I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blo@@ oming tendency and the wild fav@@ ors of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men everyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary called &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was dism@@ iss@@ al of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , and what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Industry , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 persons , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month seized the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to carry out their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ lined BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarette champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco b@@ aton of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is lab@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of the damages of most products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tions of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , said former head of channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for taking public @-@ law programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which are clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program finan@@ ces programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am happy to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his commentary on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows would sell like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little from the BBC &apos;s production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and with the commercial transm@@ itters , Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ ural systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work through the activation of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bu@@ bbles .
the bu@@ bbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy ultr@@ asound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound waves can pass un@@ imp@@ eded and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily become suscep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation remains strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ handed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from easy to nerve writing down to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to che@@ er : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where and where you took the Sabbath year , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those you would not talk to even if your lashes ri@@ bbed on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal gathering points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert is a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have spent for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a door that was not closed was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less wei@@ rd than the greeting of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got you something baked . so , and now please smile when I present you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make people feel sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a jar of r@@ ins@@ ing to their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or working .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ts to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighb@@ ors if they were able to make some noise , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with even more lau@@ re@@ ate music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before letting their own music be angry , shut their door and went to their three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of them , dis@@ connect and then have to see them every day , and maybe see how they bring together all the common friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to give your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has left his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is more subtle than it seems .
a good stu@@ d is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut down your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ income , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner ental ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the ear@@ ner more alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displac@@ ed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , excluding land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building instructions complic@@ ate their plans ?
guil@@ der : I have successfully passed my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space arrangement .
gr@@ assy .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ rac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ rac@@ ed project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ ds : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which definitely is not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : true is , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but built in luxury homes that hardly can afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , the ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the mother alone , or the ear@@ then @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build even today cheap and well .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typ@@ ing &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after the installation , since they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made that impro@@ b@@ able due to the sli@@ mm@@ ing of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may shut down half way and lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ fre@@ unde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen supports G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein counter@@ acted .
this makes it possible for players not to record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ studio looks for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Anton@@ assi@@ ft Al@@ ten@@ zentrum have joined forces under the Co@@ at of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consulting , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , we receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health care insurance or the benefits of health and nursing homes .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant nursing service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions there .
&quot; many services of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is scar@@ c@@ ely understood , &quot; explained the new hou@@ se@@ keeper J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as Head of Business Al@@ ten@@ Hilfe , also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the Amb@@ ul@@ atory Service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the sal@@ udi@@ s were taken with the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the salon complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s , described the retirement centre for care and care .
both business leaders see the reason for opening the new district office in the city centre in particular in demo@@ graphic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure required in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , as under@@ lined mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation cerem@@ onies , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ alising presence . &quot;
in this way , the social fund will make a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently as possible in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

with the city of Bremen the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decide whether me@@ adow will be displayed , or not .

witnesses looks for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the walk from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the top of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young man and hit him in his face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al pu@@ n and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .

the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .

Dr. Frank Müller to handle field breaks and investment 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
in addition , Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , Mayor of Economics , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on hand with his successor in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the field @-@ raising years ago Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , met who currently completed her professional training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arbage could fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I called it just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple m@@ iller founded the idea to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the g@@ arbage cans bought the house with practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior consultant in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior ambul@@ ance in the di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K read@@ iness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the g@@ arbage cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ ologists .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 500@@ 00 Euro is received by the g@@ arbage collection in the context of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Bernd Bor@@ mann , Mayor of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average business there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers consultation hours , by the way , continue to look at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the clean@@ ser from the field .
with their departure , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the medical profession has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
they already feel a little melanch@@ ol@@ y after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; up to now I have always kept myself in front of gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not even the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ies
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel prosp@@ ective refugees towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to not settle its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government said , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could access them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly taking place in the Croatian town of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country has roughly 4,000 refugees , said Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were led by the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which hi@@ ther@@ to led migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government however denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , further buses were expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did so , so the police told us we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a distance further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ oj@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it details but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied to the country a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
the Serbian Minister of Interior , Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , tried to calm a local sus@@ pic@@ ion in Hor@@ gos in an early morning : he uph@@ old the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at present be about very high number of refugees .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distribut@@ ing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , insi@@ der shops are to be made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately tra@@ pped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other def@@ end@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim parking space .
people take care of their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ em@@ akers , partly comfortably walking .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , bo@@ unc@@ ing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle there are four big tables in each case with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spont@@ aneously attacks the chal@@ k and compl@@ ements the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; can stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; , others remain short , read , say sets like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ asi@@ an Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Relief .
this is why this promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the tables , however , be understandable , finally it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly helped people to open up .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the first @-@ hour volunteers .
confronted with the subject by personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ th@@ an@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was seeking volunteers , she immediately contacted and participated in the creation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the victim and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job well and the experiences and experiences he has made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and confes@@ sional .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and ob@@ struction atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees will be offered every two years .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supplier gig@@ ant lowered his share of profits for a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ carrying service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex has announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. promised to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a pol@@ l of Fac@@ t@@ Set , anal@@ ysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower view comes despite the price increases that amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of the growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income yields the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holidays employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which were subject to twelve anal@@ ysts asked by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US dollars .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s in@@ quired anal@@ ysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in cargo business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening on them at one end of the two @-@ story seat of seats is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : to keep US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representatives anx@@ ious to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a Wa@@ iting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising a further increase far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average increased by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the campaign was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a rate increase would re@@ assure the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be necessary , an increase in the pro@@ position expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world were coming together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Requi@@ rement fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the high season of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Central Bank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed so it should not be involved in making decision making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere mention of the director of that time Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; dissolved confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but can also be consul@@ ted with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a raise interest rate , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis like the market breakthrough in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est Expl@@ oration of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 conferences , she still loves to teach .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ ers home at Dill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is another lesson than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women on shock@@ ing women about how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited ech@@ o@@ ing of the Bern@@ rie@@ der sport grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent council meeting , the work carried out without major discussions was unanim@@ ously closed .
before that , the Panel had , among other things , adopted an application for a regulatory &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with no @-@ bearing first and roof over@@ lay &quot; is to be built .
the planned use of the roof area for solar plants is the background of the planning : &quot; this is how we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn was meant to be under ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the a@@ version does not allow &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally more restric@@ tive in the case of liberation presentations .
in the field of gymn@@ asi@@ um , however , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the District Council Office for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH in the district , confirmed by the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , the Supervisory Board is deci@@ ding on this decision , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who cannot reach Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has triggered the change and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; recovery &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree on both houses , the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schafts Hospital , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations .
at present there is a short term care for Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hunter case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the ab@@ err@@ ement on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police told .
after a shooting a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .

missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a susp@@ ect has led the police to cor@@ p@@ se the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rheinland @-@ Pfalz , missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the teenagers were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ st@@ ened on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be indeed susp@@ ect , who in fact stated the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had@@ n &apos;t come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the quest for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the event of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing people there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities to stop the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a bomb on him .
the further investigation is to bring about the near@@ er circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the forth@@ coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; Social Res@@ idential Development . &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
in this way , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is moving a flat defic@@ it , which is growing year @-@ by @-@ year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ e@@ ously in WG rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Res@@ idential Development &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives are intended to revi@@ ve social housing construction .
this way , the land tax will be dispens@@ ed with and the properties of subsidi@@ zed flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation opportunities are necessary according to the alliance .
the support programme for refugee camps in the state bank Kf@@ W is already working well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia stra@@ igh@@ ten cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escap@@ ing to Hungary anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces to grant entry through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day make extraordinary asylum procedures in Hungary super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police seized the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as ta@@ xis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not pushing the fence .
for this , the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance can now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police numbered 366 .
shortly before the closing of the door on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws increase the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; established at the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be deport@@ ed there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ former &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they collected the g@@ arbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border site was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
Austria , following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country following government directions .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly encountered on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with the clearing as there were suddenly ten people standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , mayor of Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Near Pass@@ au .
we had previously ta@@ sted the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els in order to prove it after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of assi@@ sting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the establishment of structures in order to ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the sphere of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which it has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for vulnerable people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the look@@ out for 3@@ 5.000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Konrad has fully occupied all his hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has appointed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; first pick @-@ up center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday would also be without a major vort@@ ex , &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the federal states , 15@@ ,000 the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provin@@ cial govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
the asylum coordin@@ ator also places great expectations on the ORF action &quot; Help , &quot; as we do . &quot;
on the platform , private persons can offer accommodation easily .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ators must hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful with his experience , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ lem@@ an , whom one does not say in the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to explain how they themselves declared .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the suffer@@ ers cannot currently be subject to these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , other sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the city boss critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees in the federal state .
other areas also have to make their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has corro@@ ded further action in the refugee issue .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment .
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the Start@@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T plans to cooperate with the new neighb@@ ors - which is what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from tech@@ c@@ Enter , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and tech@@ c@@ Enter .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit really wanted to lay out a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Arc@@ ade : after all , she received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business in which they are sold including bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything is turning around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz market that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I feel most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women come to the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , the specialist can not answer l@@ ately .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign enemy , is concerned with journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US president &apos;s office is att@@ acking the campaign strongly .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ ehn @-@ hair@@ style is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine @-@ road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village are related to it over -@@ zig @-@ corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter fashion , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ot@@ ings , including Tr@@ ump also the k@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - according to the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , there tend to be the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big m@@ ole &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the len@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the country in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s D@@ ogs , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally prominent statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ishes , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born dump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement rather sees the Americans dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so bri@@ ghtening . &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump comes out ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the host@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned , as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family ended with a visit for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t tear the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the Sa@@ ws at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cin@@ emas , also in the USA the interest is awakening .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first mountain village .
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for Sustainable Tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson are rus@@ hing to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
the dis@@ advantage of the u@@ prising did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as the sunrise sc@@ ored approximately 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the past few months , the gap to Sunrise was closed .
today , Today , Today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 .
at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 viewers in September , sunrise will be at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decided to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe y@@ iel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Seat will end up at 17 : 30 .

the last three match : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
un@@ vei@@ led a mystery ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the Bachelor wins .
the woman , where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you might have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips locked up to the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood was the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the very first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam &apos;s energies saw it , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made her clear last week that Wood &quot; could be the one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set up on him , &quot; she said .
and when asked who Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams looking after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne on the Bank for the rest of the game when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts on Tuesday 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to strengthen Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after F@@ um@@ ble and later told Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian tur@@ f with force of arms .
having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned to conf@@ isc@@ ate Yu@@ kos &apos;s oil company and prevented his democratic efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free vot@@ ers demand the recru@@ itment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the Free El@@ ection Conference conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , quite different main topics were provided .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Cho@@ ose Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the war in the 1990s in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ ose boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ v@@ anger also asked more staff for the administrative court responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W CEO cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is moving away , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Acade@@ mic Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch , &quot; where an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ al intermediate level will be tested for three to four years - in the end it will take nine years to the final grade .
but Ai@@ v@@ anger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums wishing to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after an over @-@ wide routes , the German stock market has concluded a trend @-@ less and nervous trading course with profits .
it was only in the afternoon that a stronger op@@ ener of the US stock exchanges provided a clear direction which ultimately carried the D@@ ax up by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X of medium @-@ sized values gained 0,@@ 54 per cent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ D@@ ax climb@@ ed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as a leading index in the euro@@ zone declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points .
solid profits also made the trading places in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently recorded around 1 percent in Plus .
many stock tra@@ ders expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate in the US and also for the big deteri@@ oration at the fut@@ ures exchange .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear issue has temporarily pushed the shares of R@@ WE into a record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.9 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend .
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future @-@ based w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditional weak summer months of August more cars were picked up than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA rus@@ hed to the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the paper@@ work by Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits were driven by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Swiss pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro sank in the afternoon to last 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at noon the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .
the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a four @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot a crowd of people demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior civil servant , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , throwing stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs from you .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets that were used are known to kill , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ fel@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Gl@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10th .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step toward a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been ruled centrally for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that in April had killed thousands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legis@@ lators agreed this week about certain cl@@ auses in the Kath@@ mand@@ u constitutional bill , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for corresponding offers , it is called the city .
which investor demand is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the plot that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and the building on which it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the holiday homes on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor presented plans for the project .
many residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their refuge .
for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , bar@@ bec@@ u@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday homes on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the interest , mid @-@ size Em@@ den Company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which pres@@ ided over the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went into the offensive by the system construction company : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent reactions among marine land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; it will be a giant ring that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; entire bus loads must come , so that it pays off , &quot; says Schulz .
but what is exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign aimed at bringing $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation request on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global collected donations up to a value of $ 5.5 million will be doubled to goo@@ g@@ le.com / l@@ el@@ low to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article about the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the magn@@ itude of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital recorded data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease caused the disease to be completely and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely eliminated only by one percent , and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared with the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conven@@ tionally .
although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people interested in BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is increasingly noticed in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so also in the recent novel , &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she could place a literary monument to her hom@@ et@@ own .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
toxic control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand san@@ iti@@ sing agents in children under 12 years of age , reported by po@@ ison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are coming to these products more and more frequently , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have suppos@@ edly mixed inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ sers ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent which are very attractive for children .
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very small children can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation in particular for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison@@ ing centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ ented hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold considered to be dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to death cases by alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , died in Ontario , containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities believe that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York had planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their space .
the police considered the failed plan as a &quot; bul@@ let &quot; and referred disciplinary measures to the school authorities .

during a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision between Nordr@@ ing and On Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ bar in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and realised too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his lor@@ ry and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta before .
the police took part in the vehicles involved in the accident , about 10 000 euros .

odo@@ urs : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glas@@ g@@ ow , D@@ ei@@ la admitted that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .

in the first half of the year , Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter gave Aber@@ deen a brief victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , giving the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede on Dish@@ on@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glas@@ g@@ ow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ aneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare themselves for con@@ frontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about returning the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m @-@ games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ ei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ ei@@ la has accepted Celtic struggles , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ells to turn things around .
after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic has had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need Celtic , really support because that makes the players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
getting together is so important .
W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton carefully on January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , he pointed out that he ha@@ st@@ ened some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton is careful about the signing of new in@@ accessible and insi@@ sts that he does not want to dis@@ rupt the on@@ eness of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der@@ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this high season to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things up - but it is clear that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ pson &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back on tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive division victory , giving them a lead of five points from Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases in the UK overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the total of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland decreased by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ing sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed .
when the day drew closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as oft@@ en@@ times more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery instead of deci@@ ding who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner about how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she was dre@@ aming that she &quot; could have phr@@ ased it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a journalist of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ esis would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt jumping test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain .
he had held back 18 months because of the sp@@ y accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to change my head and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more co@@ aches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to pick up his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should surely touch their nos@@ es because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to believe that it will be personal ?
R@@ V@@ L has a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and makes people outside of trainers who are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and b@@ ump me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he said he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master@@ piece Black Caviar , described the Race Day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debates which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it also had it on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy to fight against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of ring struggle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favourites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the judges allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled note about the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they were concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact &quot; at tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about mar@@ tial arts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our def@@ ensive system or techniques all year round . but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy had attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts by George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a sh@@ it of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters sc@@ ored a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are they p@@ auses ? or are there any points of excitement ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final round of A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Cleaning
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long penalty for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ el@@ ong@@ ated penalty for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café he might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he travels to Serbia often , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he checks his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , reports to the police daily and has a cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks took part in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver spot@@ ted it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
the cab of the accident @-@ causing c@@ aster ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ist used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as this fell asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ appropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping dog .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web search , which used terms for the search for unused images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; educ@@ ation@@ ists on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be ad@@ dic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then also saw the in@@ consistent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused took computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ow@@ es himself guilty to the act of indictment , to have taken innocent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because he could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was given a ref@@ und@@ able deposit but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual crimes .
trac@@ tors switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks reli@@ ed on smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river @-@ river Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs to the German side .
there they are received by the German police officer and forwarded to the registration .
following the German Federal Police Reg@@ ulations , more refugees arrived in the Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the start of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , hot sea air currents in the country currently stream into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) was distributed in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot storms and th@@ under@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest , Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake Con@@ stance District with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour , are to be expected in the Black Forest .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the crowd makes it : every two years the cars at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly on the move to the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations ac@@ counted for this segment , according to the German Federal Environment Agency ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Publi@@ cation date 17th to 27th of September ) .
in this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new premium cars and luxury cars .
one of the largest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , Hessen also offers more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the combination , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA or on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door fan in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment by Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan fe@@ eder wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines perfectly fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
on offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is powered by gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact DS 4 compact car that is visible at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n chassis laid hands on the front end : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the re@@ plen@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI are also available at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court ruled on an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons concerned may even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , was now on the open foot , moved to a larger cell .
his term of liability for the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for renewed trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able time period only a few days of arrest for compensation were decisive , there was an equ@@ ation of compensation , said it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear the personality of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is decent .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had st@@ oned a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
for three months , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell like in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
cap@@ tives are therefore always shut up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even at fights , it should have already occurred due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany following forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , it takes between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0,000 apartments ) .
but the lack of housing is dramatic , especially at affordable rental properties : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing annually fall out of the rental price bond , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social housing annually would have to emerge and for that the federal government would have to invest USD 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and Federal Minister for the Interior agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of working for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was earlier a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to residence , which restri@@ cts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the short@@ age of skilled labour - the point of view prev@@ ails that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration noted that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the divor@@ ced parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ke , spokes@@ man for the youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators to rise shar@@ ply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational training schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ cases from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees intend to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state may asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ate the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position .
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or divor@@ ce do not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they start a study .
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the people entitled to leave .
toler@@ ated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 this span short@@ ens to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ es@@ sively emp@@ ower Islam the same rights as churches have , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to commit such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination and general gender equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German already require long and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ ra@@ cial conflict Germany commit must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally care for the refugees expected so far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding MAN@@ - Power and Capacity we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites everyone to sign up health cards .
services rendered may later be b@@ illed with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to pull off so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers .
as before , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse informed about their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ter costs should be taken over , it demands .
but many of the refugees would have been helped with more general medical institutions in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugee camps , for example , there are clearly more untreated physical disabilities , and among the young people there is about HIV @-@ raising .
but with some of the other illnesses German doctors came from her apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , but clearly she says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps even allevi@@ ation is in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re @-@ perform tests once again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Chamber of Psych@@ otherapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suff@@ ers from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
but up to now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in social @-@ offices , skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging of passion , Cir@@ cus pro@@ hi@@ des the traditions of circ@@ us art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the Cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circ@@ us family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ orch@@ phone .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual production of real estate .
for more than 33 years , the circ@@ us has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Junior Squ@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ goat &apos;s cocktail with a cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan fla@@ ir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 towns on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the circ@@ us program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian st@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov c@@ lown family pul@@ ls the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo now wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon let@@ tu@@ ce , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intu@@ ition and ten@@ derness .
balance with the un@@ icy@@ cle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ake people fascinated and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circ@@ us animals are very often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also comments : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lov@@ ingly called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be picked up by the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena as well .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stal@@ lion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is the family day , the prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m .
the animal show is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them against accompanying the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with calls .
last month they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Members concerned that immun@@ ity ends in Parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard opens up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , CEO of HP and Chief Executive who will lead unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ ri@@ cher , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger empha@@ sized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history , his participation in the next summer in the European Championship is still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a big matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of the ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , who have recorded most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation inside the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and indul@@ ge the players who need it to take a break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s favorites are to progress through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale of 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven from the far @-@ away hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ ti@@ ful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication managed by social media , with emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , alive and successful , even though the isolation in reality domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often go back to explore fully their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the phone past@@ oral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and risk @-@ threatening has shown me clearly how even the sli@@ ghtest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give it a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Mal@@ m@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as the PSG player who brought the French Master to the road , but after that she missed a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani increased her lead in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Donetsk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to create problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we need to perfect during the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who took the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he was running in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that he would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Mal@@ m@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they did little in attack .
instead , PSG itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ ped alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot , who was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute passing by at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth seasonal goal after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before the substitute E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gate at the end .
the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG was playing a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore raises $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based Gl@@ enc@@ ore mining giant , which is affected by falling commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a share sale as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan .
the Gl@@ enc@@ ore company registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately $ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ enc@@ ores &apos;s share price on trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the head of the London stock exchange .
the share stood at 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to blo@@ t about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns over long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices fell by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and re@@ acts President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan in a Sta@@ ats @-@ D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time also President Obama and President X@@ i give the opportunity to construc@@ tively tackle areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced first in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 changes to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice European champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now advis@@ es that he was already leaving Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid received everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says .
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ mi@@ an wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for it works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi declares why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;

matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out when this empha@@ sized the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments by the actor of The Mar@@ tian un@@ le@@ ashed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - whoever is always the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a whi@@ p that is beaten by her white stal@@ lion .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ gan@@ y expressed his rage about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - that is SO WE@@ ISS it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 cases since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement nation@@ wide and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against farming .
in February the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated films of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ eries invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Ninja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport cli@@ m@@ ber and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Ninja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the finale .
the last task was to climb a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of the American Ninja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or lived for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Br@@ itten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great bar@@ b@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s h@@ ating about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad there &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Ninja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tiger loop past Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Det@@ roit tig@@ ers .
formerly they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their roles as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the Tw@@ ins wast@@ ed a chance to climb inside a game h@@ emisph@@ ere of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Det@@ roit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kir@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Det@@ roit sc@@ ored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ fight every game , and so I want to go all the way into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the logs well , &quot; he said .
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better in the Bull@@ dog , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh in@@ ward , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran a wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run wren@@ ch from the right @-@ h@@ anders Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclu@@ ding run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe sm@@ ashed a double play
after Det@@ roit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , the Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth outlet .
Det@@ roit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the infrin@@ gement list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers grew in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he didn &apos;t hit especially well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four k@@ outs .
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to shoulder ri@@ pping , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the Tw@@ ins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in this area should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it comp@@ etes with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
in the last ten days alone , the pres@@ idents of the government pres@@ ided over 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse after the pres@@ i@@ ding of the pres@@ i@@ ding pres@@ i@@ dium of the government .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria is an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented the European states &quot; collective way@@ points . &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
nor did Germany return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , &quot; I have already given relevant talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete numbers and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee stream in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also compl@@ ain .
but if you do not have a pencil prosp@@ ective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was expressed in an impressive way in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole had to deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was also sealed with a fence .
this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia in the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ gs from escap@@ ing over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants in Turkey went on their way to the Greek border .

these include researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
as a result , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its path around the ring planets .
this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a solid heavenly body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the specialist paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible obligation of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the six@@ ties presented a def@@ ensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain plenty of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often not recommended by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
anyone who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleas@@ antly smell .
the color of the peel alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it soft@@ ens the slightly bitter taste of some leaves such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

first filling storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ ina side of the fo@@ ehn , how Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair dryer sometimes b@@ lows with a storm @-@ strength through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
after com@@ promis@@ ers on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind bu@@ cks and a decrease in temperature .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure region across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps the f@@ öhn stops in the night to Wednesday the fo@@ ehn .
subsequently , the hair dryer until Thursday morning f@@ ades in the valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the fo@@ ehn can penet@@ rate up to the ad@@ joining centre @-@ edge , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ ehn for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees lum@@ ens , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here , rain continues , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some over 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be calculated , this after large ra@@ inf@@ all have already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer moves out , in which a cold front rolls through Switzerland with a vigor@@ ous , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east .
together with the cold front the wind will refres@@ h strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are far back .
the following days are coming autumn in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino an un@@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority .
with this place it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a de@@ pra@@ ved sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
according to hist@@ ori@@ ans , his negative impressions might have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
hammer Pain@@ ter invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective and artistic choice of the many subject areas of the book of all books .
there were cycles dedicated to themes such as cross @-@ path , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ hood .
in doing so , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scriptures on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current contex@@ ts into today .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of AL@@ T@@ s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has gold letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family which belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler Order .
&quot; the up@@ bringing took place with the cane , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out to bear with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to rein@@ force the art of art in a fast @-@ living time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed there .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; let them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar AL@@ T@@ s art has always been : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not taken care of completely cap@@ turing the Bible , but selecting the topics that are important to him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar AL@@ T@@ s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration caused the dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the rail@@ road .
so hills deport@@ ed , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first joint minister Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is going to happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then begin with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a further pause .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is making a clear mark on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
the decisive turn@@ out , however , must put politics .
the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend the 36 professional clubs place a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot jam instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on every day , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can say no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig said about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
for the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach also called for the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licence agreements had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of tremendous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will be providing 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the associations have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses an eye in case of accident
according to Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost his left eye through a fall in early July .
with the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , f@@ ain@@ ted , then drag@@ ged out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP because of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can happen to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore did not ask Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button when he dis@@ races in Singapore on the weekend , just as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : village F@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Round against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its tri@@ bal position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change at the gate guard position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open for use in all European League matches in the future .
with high probability , he will also deny the second game .
the for@@ ge statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl resist@@ s : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technolog@@ ically advanced in the course of the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , anticip@@ ates investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show in a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also plans to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states coming together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and fast moving to digital radio .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; verify the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars to be lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
in addition , the German government wants to make use of a change in the Vienna Convention , which hi@@ ther@@ to only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical , much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ational organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those ques@@ tioned by 2025 will reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .
well , each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to current status , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to compete only in single , from 25th September to 4th October .
the final decision is to be made latest on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage is that we are no longer such a clear Favor@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ w@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings @-@ fifth .
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United was a serious injury to the right leg .
at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was pointed out by Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ steiger &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow @-@ player .
G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of big fashion show and a wax figure cu@@ ff cabinet : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te c@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation on 18 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition so@@ unded a bit like death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely opaque work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work for which much effort was carried out : in order to fres@@ hen up the d@@ olls , for example a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers car@@ ded 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , succ@@ ul@@ ent fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , G@@ aul@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past it went to the long nitrogen @-@ machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , who worked for example on blank@@ ets and curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Power Distribution Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is again important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Tip , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is based on past styl@@ istic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
split Slots Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been anticipated .
private business transactions and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass @-@ ware is nowadays much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively by chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have produced a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design often only slightly varies to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ designed the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little chi@@ ckens in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; previously I could not start with traditional pl@@ um tip . &quot;
now she uses the Snow@@ ball Point for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and its surroundings and who want a souven@@ ir .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it &apos;s not about a re @-@ movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still uncle@@ ar .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , at least with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned to steering the reform .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new spin @-@ offs will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance as it assign@@ s a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how they manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .

EU wants to double the level of mercury in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission is aiming to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus increase consumers a significantly higher dose of neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters .
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a working paper of the EU , shar@@ ply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors have already been so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ common .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ ps , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned peak values .
the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de dist@@ rac@@ tion man@@ oeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt explained .
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is especially rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish via the food chain .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; already small volumes can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the highest possible values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury passes through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants viol@@ ate more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and the Danube , was &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been c@@ ited out of paper in March .
last year , mercury in fish accounts for Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
