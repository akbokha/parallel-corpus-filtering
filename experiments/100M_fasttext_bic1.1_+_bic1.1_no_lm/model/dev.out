Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meeting , however , it should also be the conflict with Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been curious for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two wor@@ sen@@ ed about the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the forth@@ coming election of Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught at two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sign@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency call at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctor@@ ate in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the wom@@ bs of women .
all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se that worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September for the last time that Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean rooms and cher@@ ished each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for the Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season staff like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to work more hours to the employees and seasonal workers .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired in the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the holidays are still more months , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops , sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox scre@@ ams over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and a length of arm away from being with the pr@@ incess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says , its response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its of the Council and the Syrian people and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria to cope with the achievement of nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but aliens groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Iranian vot@@ ers believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and almost six of 10 independent say that his tem@@ per does not p@@ asse to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they set up their past@@ oral care , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since then , when four of ten end of July you put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers show Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting multiple support .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public dis@@ course was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high levels .
in the meantime , in Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited to nature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices occurs as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top right here .
Champions League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ times Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller turned the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack@@ ers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League in the Champions League , Müller received good assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a flan@@ k of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ held word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including against famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ v@@ ent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ a@@ geous in their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by game rel@@ ocation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bayern moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to sit soft@@ ly .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer , however , was forgiveness .
for example , when he pul@@ ls a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport pres@@ et Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the s@@ wollen Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ Meter Müller sat on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially confused Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently the supporters of hosts Pir@@ eus had prov@@ oked with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : the risk of ren@@ unciation decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , around 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss go back to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to the extent that smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Bo@@ eing said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to good dental health until the old age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of teeth imp@@ unity , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .

for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne Arch@@ eological finds have been made .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological monuments .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now about five .
from text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
apart from the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves that probably belonged to the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to shar@@ pen the strike on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its mode of operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Mal@@ m@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de must introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely show that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
for the first time it is also a second instance .
it would allow to raise obj@@ ection to verdi@@ cts .
until now , the proceedings agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , a claim against their verdi@@ cts did not exist .
in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Mal@@ m@@ ström commented .
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own information .
there could then be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , mainly of major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , as a result of the company &apos;s damages to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to stand out national laws or to implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially cri@@ tici@@ zed that they should not apply to the negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economy Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considers essential points to reform the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Mal@@ m@@ ström .
the European company BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continued unab@@ ated on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no more durable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places that he always records on the map what his min@@ u@@ c@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they came and how it looks , in his homeland .
ever since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; sounds smart composed songs , which are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a missed series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine there is already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and breaks positively certain expectations .

the album climb@@ s into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of the influ@@ ential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic assembly pieces .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister frei@@ ghter
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the frei@@ ghter of the prime minister is expected with tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs , and is at the heart of several tit@@ els@@ ets stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also stap@@ le within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to make Labour amend@@ ments to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they are only against government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory Head , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions about Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire is con@@ front@@ ational , and that it is subjected to both &quot; impact &quot; and strike with re@@ hooks , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy le Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of the part of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

the pound climb@@ s rapidly to data which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in addition , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the S@@ BM@@ iller encoder target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and experienced ass@@ essments of the time of an increase in interest .
the pound climb@@ ed by more than 1 % compared to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro at 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .

the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the capital : on Bi@@ eber expedition in Berlin

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vi@@ kings would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and at every doll that looks like he and over the counter goes , Bi@@ eber also assi@@ sts .
if Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window pane .
he is to be exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others emphasize that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and Great Britain with its new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , the many zer@@ os are not interested .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to a potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and indeed in the potato twe@@ eter , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the Spru@@ ch &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster using a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally saw in television .
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ha@@ y says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes in the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash launches Boden@@ stan@@ dig campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - Ein@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a stand @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and store shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell sold tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Invest@@ ors strategy day .
there is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around € 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash was in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food stores , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in terms of sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler continues to invest and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week to improve their stores through fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs will grow on Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; came into the spot@@ light by the in@@ famous con@@ frontation of Cy@@ ril with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice through the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , with Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to cr@@ ush a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f led a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ g@@ ow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m rather jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled down a bit into the quar@@ rel , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost because of a cra@@ p in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ ril in the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be fully concentrated on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has made a very quick climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , but we try to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his action . some time outside of the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropri@@ ately , and it is best for the crew and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency stop , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary states the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were taken back from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ati@@ ous meeting in Brussels could not reconc@@ ile common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bel@@ low action of Brussels or his neighb@@ ors .
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison passengers were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for condemned tra@@ ffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs in days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come down by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushing a crowd to go there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit leap in the democratic race in order to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination at national level but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face towards the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is at second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and vegetables , but these jum@@ ps have reduced .
their support among men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage in democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit leap in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reserves and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections would like to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers of the elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
from Clin@@ tons followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far off S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this number fell by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; choice &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the vot@@ ability .
similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important tra@@ its among vot@@ ers in the elections of their party .
be@@ au@@ ties consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut by the three candidates for hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic vot@@ ers of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers has no opinion from S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as an external minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton are worse .
although Clinton is considered hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent sees them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate countries also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership .
the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best for hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of it .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times po@@ em behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support of the vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and ski@@ pped tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen on the deepest , while 10 % support last month is now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the bug margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - he lands with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at one of Car@@ son &apos;s last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even rises up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , assass@@ inations were submitted to five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hiding utensils &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Poli@@ sch@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third degree for the first five members .
two @-@ and @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of religious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this has been sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest rate is coming , and the hous@@ ings will fall into stag@@ nant , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the exp@@ ir@@ ation process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , alb@@ eit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could notice that the whole excitement was possibly over@@ done because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends that could react to some areas of the economy :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest expenses can make things for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to decrease assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study to what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only exceeded the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants took the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increasing cycles of 1950 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market anticip@@ ates interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in the fact that yields between longer and shorter bonds bring closer together and lead to a defl@@ ection of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the profitability curve has increased , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that deal with the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debt will get worse as an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest expenses 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how quickly it will take place .

BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private transm@@ itters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enlighten@@ ment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works in order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder to work to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire came under fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated $ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bor@@ row@@ ed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sale index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers started working with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is , and we will possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which will be held last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 has been issued a little more than 1 £ online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in M@@ ec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims among the first funer@@ als in M@@ ec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the gigantic Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s Grand @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
dreams filled , largely dressed in white , the route to z@@ ure their respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funer@@ al proc@@ ession passed over to the Holy Place , where only a few days before a building crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funer@@ al , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dec@@ ors who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee M@@ ec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month , gathered themselves together .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European crafts@@ men is over
Br@@ its increasingly occupy crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe climb@@ ed up
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at crafts@@ men , will be opened
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified East European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
for the British are increasingly handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at crafts@@ men and to close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that exhibit more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this into a balance .
in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed companies , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occup@@ ies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group owed the costs for closing the shops .
due to the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob on Wednesday .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for official use .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the def@@ end@@ ants were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial periods .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in the absence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that the association was not an asset to the association at any time .
the sports function@@ aries would only have reb@@ elled and the sports club , for whom they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue or lock the club , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profes@@ sions of the financial am@@ ts .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money to lay our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed upon : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made .
furthermore , in the case of financial success , the withdrawal of the expenses of the expenses was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore one has paid a part of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus was paid to the account .
for this reason , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings books managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not covered in detail in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial sector , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account in 2011 .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
on top of that , the respon@@ dent had no answer .
then he thought he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused would have been informed , the function@@ ary was justified .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim compensation . &quot;
why claims ? , Ju@@ dge and Prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never caused a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a c@@ ents salary , he spent only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer been kept , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he explained in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ ats more 30,000 jobs
in addition to ongoing personnel reduction for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting .
the Stell@@ enst@@ reich@@ ungen at the U.S. computer terri@@ fic Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer sector .
this will reduce costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars starting from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share delivered 2.3 percent .
the company with printers from California &apos;s Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto is currently on the market : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales and a we@@ aker demand for corporate customers after its services continued to last the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers returned by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry with a split and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted late , that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and more and more shops do the same online .
in total , Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will see the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq , however , would be mostly in rejection . 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ front against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
he told us by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water designer ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially set up an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn slightly .
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as cried .
other refugees were sack@@ ed and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ man of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US staff arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the present state of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on N@@ ULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less spectacular view of global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm C@@ ET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University dism@@ issed exc@@ itation letter
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be disturbed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb took relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb received a doctor@@ ate in spring 2015 from Delta State University as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug owners .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group building .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa expands its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is an income contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and redemption syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will be no longer a board member of the passenger business in the future .
the image airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike was stopped .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the rule of rest for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as quickly as possible results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes during the past few months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots , the pilot concept is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is fores@@ een that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors moves on the Group &apos;s own image line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer defender to the we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be rel@@ oc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then playing fantastic and then it happens .
in the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the United Kingdom Defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving towards another direction so that it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that will soon learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost agile .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to cover the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead of giving a summary of the 2012 film version , added the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron has become so little familiar to the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , fal@@ sely dist@@ rac@@ ted by the gre@@ edy , trees pr@@ one , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ enden On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ eless being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that has chosen England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ ep players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully hits further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Mo@@ een go next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and receive four qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this link h@@ anders has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred branches immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their st@@ ats - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ den , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful action into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u if the economy up to 2017 was in a raft
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ating strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was viol@@ ently crushed for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ er said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , just as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at its re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a blin@@ king power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the British British to prevent their energy from preventing Scotland from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers might even deliberately plan not helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press level , as they did not support in 1975 during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; EU Straight Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa sitting in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him rather than to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never left him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it friendly - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ epr@@ int tendency and the wild cor@@ il@@ ding of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns was the appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s years when his old father endeav@@ oured to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without losing too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital , they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to get funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , of which some also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco director of P@@ he also took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is indic@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products for most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that on the claims by BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less damaging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year .
through the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national competence .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former CEO of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are likely to be seen from a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial tim@@ ed windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t think of medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put its production on programs that do not make or commission others .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that anyone else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programmes could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I want to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led by channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course you think all of us think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform , form and maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and with the commercial transm@@ itters alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment they have to be heard with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work through the activation of Mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used for ultr@@ asound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that canc@@ els electrical impulses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bu@@ bbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when he uses ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ flowers and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed Mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily become suscep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

&quot; important announcement : go from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which converts to the image of a tank .

after G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a le@@ verage of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments do not act illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors show fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ winding up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to w@@ ad : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where you get in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and tear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not think about getting to the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a Com@@ milit@@ one is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the high point of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade delic@@ acies is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat cause people to face sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check this with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent human being , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighb@@ ors if they had something to do , Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighb@@ ors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour review .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ed if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to dis@@ connect and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they mig@@ rate to each other &apos;s shared friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his not locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine when it seems .
a good st@@ ale is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys into a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t tor@@ ch their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , single people , Ger@@ ing@@ ers@@ ener
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the middle Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of ter@@ rac@@ ed ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displac@@ ed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very simple , three @-@ story ter@@ rac@@ ed house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have taken my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch arrangement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ rac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns there is no space for it .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ rac@@ ed house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that hardly afford to afford .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother alone or the poor .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that &apos;s why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , select &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by simpli@@ fying the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may be switched on hal@@ f@@ way and could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the updates .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Championships pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far and occup@@ ies the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still uncle@@ ar .
since days a glo@@ om bell hangs over the city , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &apos; Schach@@ fre@@ unde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member into his ranks , so the number of members rose to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Cross 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Tow@@ ns Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who are unable to record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his conn@@ ect@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Al@@ ten@@ zentrum have joined together under the Co@@ at of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consulting you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au was recently opened there .
right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and coun@@ sel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health and nursing staff .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; even so many benefits of the insur@@ ances are not claimed , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; the new landlord J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the sen@@ iors centre and the salon complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for opening the new district office in the city centre will see both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation cerem@@ onies , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro also devoted itself to the organisation of the association at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular contribut@@ or . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently as possible in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 pm and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm .

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and struck this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends arrived and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and passed several times there .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
the head and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim are checked by means of a stroke .
the injured person had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
up to now is only a vag@@ ue activity description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was to have been around 1,@@ 65 meters and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and en@@ quiries to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Promotion U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , have luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will continue his successor in the next few months with half a position .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at the first sight when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently took up her specialist training in the Ver@@ dener Hospital , and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arbage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the g@@ arbage bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to stay in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a head physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared from the 19th of September .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the g@@ arbage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro will receive the g@@ arbage in the framework of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average language it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dental practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel rocky breaks in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if there was no successor , it would have gone .
those who visit the g@@ arbage lesson , by the way , look still in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the field .
with their f@@ are@@ well in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical he practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ ol@@ y spread it after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have an 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and would like to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum application can make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue the refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to not produce its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours for Tuesday to pass over in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik there are constantly police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which have previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was called .
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could actually come to a somewhat further west route to the predicted shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ oj@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have been a good testimony to the country since then , concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgian media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i will continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local glance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high refugee number .
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distribut@@ ing maps where alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are still no more spacious min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock Hack@@ er : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , which has been accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , insi@@ der stores should be made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were issued to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid Mannheim has been for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable bum@@ pers .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the midst of it four big tablets each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe drew attention to her 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s as well as questions and conversations as volunteers .
while some fit spont@@ aneously to the chal@@ k and set the sentence around &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; read the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer &quot; , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , however , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and dying is still ha@@ iry with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open the people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers in the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in dying .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sought by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and was involved in the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they all have been carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with their job and experience the experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another place , keep it precious and appreciate the moment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ ality and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
every two years training courses are offered for new employees .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there are also other personal wishes to be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant sen@@ sed its winning review to a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ net transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Anno@@ un@@ ces a Profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the Financial Year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
anal@@ ysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ ilers transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it is still expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid earnings if one considers the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than the ri@@ val UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , twelve of Z@@ acks investment research surv@@ ey@@ ed anal@@ ysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks asked anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , net transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the un@@ parall@@ eled inc@@ en@@ tive through the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could force the already @-@ c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is contaminated by itself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising another increase far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value rose by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would ease the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation continued under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , while the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed &apos;s monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow their monetary expansion , &quot; dissolved confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can also be expected to monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements which apparently does not involve the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conductivity by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability to the first place during a serious crisis such as the market cycle in 2008 , said Adam S. Poz@@ nan , a former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she is still happy to teach her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ ers at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy styles
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously secured without major discussions .
before that , the committee had decided to submit an application to a construction legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; of the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; except &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; except &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof top &quot; should be erected .
in the background the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; this makes us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was in turn around the ti@@ lt , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the roof incl@@ ination does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally more restric@@ tive in case of liberation orders .
however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the Federal Council Office for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this was seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , the Supervisory Board adopted a decision on the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans are to be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace should be offered to the employees who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership as of October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
in any case , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ antry , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ils J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal short@@ age , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required ton@@ ight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at Berg@@ isches HC .

two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police hur@@ ried .
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was uncle@@ ar at first .
the criminal police are determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the yo@@ ungst@@ ers were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police hur@@ ried on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ icious person , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old person who was arrested on Tuesday evening , the fact that the investigations were drawn and the investig@@ ators lead to the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after they did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed at home .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the susp@@ ici@@ ans , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rat@@ ors led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
according to the authorities , the authorities report@@ edly admitted to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be passed on Wednesday to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter , the investig@@ ators put him to the burden .
the further investigation should take place over the immediate circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with income weak citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this results in a study on behalf of the association &quot; Social Housing Construction . &quot;
for comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers during the first three months of their stay .
many hit the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany stra@@ igh@@ tens up a residential defic@@ it , which is bigger from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has decreased again for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives should be stimul@@ ated by the social housing construction .
this could be om@@ itted on the city tax , and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee camps of the Kf@@ W state bank is now well connected with cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be exposed aggregate .
refugees have free funding : Croatia and Slovenia judge cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , there is practically no more passing through , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees were broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television channels RTL .
Hungary had sail@@ ed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , super@@ flu@@ ously super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and ta@@ xis in the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian border the refugees do not viol@@ ate border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 un@@ challenged people .
shortly before pe@@ eling on Monday , there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
in the southern Hungary Grenz@@ stadt Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
sentenced to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum requests were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; in total 94 , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children and two older people are among the applicants .
there were still 40 refugees on Wednesday morning .
but practically no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they gathered the g@@ arbage that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barrier gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the elevator , when ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the stream of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eld the bor@@ der@@ ings together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Pass@@ au .
previously , we have only ta@@ sted the un@@ hoped guests once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to make it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ bridge race spor@@ tive - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another Z@@ ig@@ tens to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping to establish structures right away in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , our Federal Chancellor officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ es Circle of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border regions with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for vulnerable people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad at the look@@ out for 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ ly quar@@ r@@ ying
Konrad has filled all his hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to make his word weight .
the government has deployed the former mighty Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without major vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ts in the he@@ uris@@ tic year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provin@@ cial people .
they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ator will also be in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must comply with a certain height of the towel holder or size of the upper part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was successful with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic as they declared themselves .
their number of employees will increase them to three to four .
so far , his own quest was not successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment because it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for an emergency , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the city leader critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not locked &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not locked .
the journey of refugees into the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence for ag@@ it@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the clever minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also re@@ plen@@ ished .
from the very beginning , S &amp; D plans to cooperate with the new neighb@@ ors - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million Euros were invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros by the tech@@ c@@ enter , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and tech@@ c@@ Enter .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened a second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the heart of the new shop .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to make a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop compared to the business in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wal@@ let are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have asked for a long time if I want to open a shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most suitable if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , the professional woman can &apos;t answer last security .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag is upgraded every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
whether he expresses himself foreign hostile to journalists or to dis@@ close knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ onic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire origin@@ ate from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some of the 1200 inhabitants of the 1200 inhabitants are related to him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del directed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t turned an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jum@@ ps , in addition to Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big m@@ ason , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold gra@@ ves in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate group was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home , failed at the Bavarian State to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged back then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; he is always so open . &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension enter@@ tain@@ er Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cin@@ emas , even in the United States the interest .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the hands of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sunrise was an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise closed the gap in the last few months .
in August Today , on average 3@@ 18.@@ 000 reached an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the ra@@ ster Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe revealed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three voices agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets un@@ vei@@ led ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unk@@ now@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in ly@@ rical ways why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - besides themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit was clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls in the same way - it is a decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a little angel like it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ se on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his embarrass@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian battle for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field behind F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that now occurs , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gay men
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thy man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian Roll@@ feld with weapons of arms .
having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned , his oil company Yu@@ kos conf@@ is@@ cated and under@@ lined its democratic efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the &quot; Free elect@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free elect@@ or@@ ate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not what we have to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elect@@ or@@ ate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more handy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .

Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3,@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
according to a dealer , there was a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; from the weekend .
accordingly , investors therefore gave too little attention to the German chip@@ builder .
the investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber boots on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after demonstr@@ ating rubber in a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bom@@ bs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before returning to rubber shells .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse , known from which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ alli@@ i say that new provinces that were formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent cl@@ ashes since 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ates the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be re@@ constructed .

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor demand is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already purchased just a few months ago and the buildings that are located on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the Holiday House on the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .

Mon@@ thly service was negoti@@ ated behind closed doors , grilled , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which presented the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends proce@@ eded from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros in the discussion .
violent reactions among land@@ bu@@ sts who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , member of the sea @-@ owner and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
moreover , as a number of other project critics , he fears that traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; all bus loads must come , so that it pays , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign aimed at bringing up 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kab@@ ul &apos;s family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our journey many dark railway and bus trips included , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately seeking help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ g@@ le.com / will be doubled to 11 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric shr@@ ub formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I , among those subjected to this operation , fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was largely triggered only by one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood @-@ level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ frac@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who undergo obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a theme that is now increasingly observ@@ able in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ et@@ own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called on to stop violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries was ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack from September 11 and set out that the violent reaction of the USA pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age have increased from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only drink because of a cheap experience .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent which are very appealing for children .
suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ in centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have to leave whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was put into an emergency reception .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ u@@ ded her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths were also associated with alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active substance .
in January three students of the fourth grade in New York planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by reporting anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
the police looked at the temp@@ ted plan as &quot; weigh@@ ting &quot; and negoti@@ ated discipl@@ ined measures to the school authorities .

I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ed in Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will spin things around , swe@@ ars D@@ ei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ amp to turn things around .
after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands out with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the players better .
to get together is so important .
W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that pointed out that he hur@@ ried some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ous at the signing of new in@@ accessible and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was cancelled later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have commented on no performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which brought them a margin of five points to Celtic on the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything in poker games or li@@ ds that won &apos;t have won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it is rising .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the UK@@ s , as the numbers of the offices for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ al commented on the latest facts and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed .
when the day draws near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as places , a ma@@ ke@@ ener lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
she said she could &quot; it would have better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a journalist of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t say really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying from unnecessary death .
man after a dam@@ p police chase @-@ hunt persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Pol@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale &apos;s police was launched on Tuesday to a house peace @-@ break incident in pel@@ vic ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pi@@ onate him and threatened to end race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race right away .
he insi@@ sted on the Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tick test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ y accus@@ ations and did not want it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long spent on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for her .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before Moo@@ dy showed the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to pick up his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ er .
if that is the case , they should surely touch their nos@@ es because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L react cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m it .
maybe they have to take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching introduced that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ f@@ aded master Black Caviar , recorded the race days treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a package of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ ands , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees acci@@ dentally applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it would have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims on ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised comment to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that she only concentr@@ ates on her &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team confi@@ dently agree that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring competitions , when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing to our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not acc@@ ust@@ omed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny , as this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase to meet them .
the Storm @-@ Team will be free at this weekend , as they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start the next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with 200,000 $ deposit on drug anch@@ or@@ age
a man who may be a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly lifetime penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argu@@ ed about Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the official declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 dollar represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ s from his Australian and Serbian passport , with the police reports daily and is holding a cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab wide apart
on Tuesday evening a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks participated in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to switch to the left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident caused completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed completely over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract educ@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ist used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for unknown images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and then he said &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation took advantage of talking to girls who saw much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the Indi@@ c@@ tment to have committed un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January this year against the constra@@ ints and not to be published before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual off@@ ences , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; may be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael prescri@@ bes the verdi@@ ct until October to get background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody because of the hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was still recorded before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual crimes .
tu@@ gs devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs made fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the River River Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been picked up more than 1000 refugees in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and ri@@ bb@@ ons to the German site .
there they are accepted by the Federal Police and re@@ directed to the registration .
at the Munich Hauptbahnhof ( Munich Central Station ) , in comparison to the start of the week , more refugees once again met again in comparison to the start of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8.00 pm , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure level over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the runner of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Henry , who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic last days .
fierce storms and th@@ under@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is still up to date in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ atic circle with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car at the IAA show its novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is particularly important to record the compact car , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are especially in demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were ac@@ counted for according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new sky@@ line and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra will not become much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there are only five @-@ door Opel Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ erer wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ allo@@ ver placed hand at the front end : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , above all , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by touch@@ screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 G@@ TI have been added to the compact class at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authority Te@@ gel , which was housed for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who was now on the open foot according to his lawyer , was transferred to a larger cell .
his term of office due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re@@ viewing there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides about the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , there was an equ@@ ation of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear a cur@@ v@@ ature of the law of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
so they did not speak to a prisoner in April because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed a decent housing in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was held every day between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore again be shut again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ids it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can create it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as built so far ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments also refugees will apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings would have to arise each year , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research , 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to residence , asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence .
in society itself - also because of the short@@ age of skilled labour - increased the point of view that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg path to work integration according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fle@@ d@@ ged parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , Spe@@ aker for Youth and Family in Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration of manus@@ cri@@ pts distri@@ butes manus@@ cri@@ pts in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without German language skills are prepared in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude .
study @-@ willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or debt do not receive any services after the asylum application Act more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ o@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the people in the group .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 this span short@@ ens to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually in@@ filtr@@ ate the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state of religion .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be a topic of the whole society more than today .
in this way , the majority society will need to change , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a general equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the stak@@ eholder groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention of Germany must become reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical attention to the expected refugees , medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding MAN@@ - Power and Cap@@ aci@@ ties , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all the people to be handed over to the registration of health cards .
services provided could be calculated later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to submit so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ ers act .
otherwise , the doctors are doing most of all the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs should be taken over .
however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical conditions in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugee camps there are clearly more un@@ tra@@ ded disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV education .
in some other cases German doctors came from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ites or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the doctor &apos;s angel may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , several refugees were even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ically ill after estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable , refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study of the TU München confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee man is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ ys and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacks the traditions of circ@@ us art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; our passion is the circ@@ us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circ@@ us family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ orch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage .
the circ@@ us has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
thus , the gift is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ orch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ goat cocktail with world city fla@@ ir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the circ@@ us program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films it wants to take the Cu@@ ban duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ v@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balancing with the icy@@ cle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ake people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of circ@@ us animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena .
the top priority is : good for the animals .
specially designed for her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stal@@ lion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says .
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained unchanged , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with repentance .
last month they had spread it and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones they warned to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but she has the title &apos; Tod &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in the Parliament , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it is divided into a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring in order to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger empha@@ sized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most injuries days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes if you come back from injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation inside the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travel@@ ed to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has pulled out the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the far hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fe@@ ast : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ nings prove among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ ti@@ ful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man to ask the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided through social media , with its focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , vibrant and successful , even if isolation domin@@ ates isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest on this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you look around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Mal@@ m@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head ball@@ room at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k too , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they do not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was cut out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG himself sometimes gave herself up , with some mis@@ p@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not less than five trials alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot that was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season gate , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that she played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League that has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is based in Switzerland , has been affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan .
the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion euros in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and dis@@ astro@@ us effects on markets .

the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi betra@@ ys that he already stood before the European departure from Barcelona before the EM 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern also registered .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ bl@@ ings wanted me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the striking man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with that he got me . &quot;
who knows how to run Bavaria &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the fourth @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she will not need behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night von H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke down when it empha@@ sized the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with animated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directed rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replies that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nation@@ wide impact and displac@@ ed legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as an hatred group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Ninja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports climbing and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Ninja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million with home .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Br@@ itten until the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge for three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the win of the Grand Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Br@@ itten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates anything about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad there is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Ninja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers cut past Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday they played perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Tw@@ ins spent a chance to ascend within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Det@@ roit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Det@@ roit pointed out three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw every game in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and so I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swe@@ pt the punch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back of the seventh inn@@ ings , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to strike out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man confronted with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive year in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Det@@ roit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed S@@ ano consists of three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ roit benef@@ ited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , and made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger placed in the second place , a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the different thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he presented the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be returned .
Germany too did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call for concrete figures and negoti@@ ated talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria about the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee transport in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view was dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force exer@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
in the night Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ gs from escap@@ ing over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , so @-@ called e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of migrants on the way to the Greek border .

under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon sh@@ rou@@ ts easily on its path around the ring plan@@ ks .
although this exchange movement is small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice blank@@ et of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich has to ren@@ ounce about a month at the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , distributed by the association .
R@@ ama had compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is expected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ edi@@ tary loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain plenty of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
for man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits supports visual acu@@ ity , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too tight and pleasant to smell .
the color of the formwork alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives heart@@ y dishes a special note .

first filling tower , then striking cold front
the coming night falls in the valleys of the Alpine side of the hair dryer , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the hair dryer partially f@@ ades through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream .
on the night@@ stand the night is breaking through the valleys during the night .
in the after@@ math of the hair dryer until Thursday morning in the valleys of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even or@@ kan@@ ards of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , which after the last few days , large quantities of rain have already fallen .
on Thursday morning the hair dri@@ es out , as a result the cold front rolls with a strong , partly t@@ wit@@ ted rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes heavily until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go clearly back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a number of nam@@ eless space in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator on Wednesday .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Rever@@ end of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a descend@@ ant of sin .
according to hist@@ ori@@ ans , his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can work quite glo@@ omy .
about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles which dedic@@ ate themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood .
with this he spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus transl@@ ates into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of AL@@ T@@ s painting .
they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately tri@@ ggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened to the pipe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art become more important in a faster time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by records today , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the images , &quot; let them look at themselves , discover and feel which power they have : &quot; the image looks for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar AL@@ T@@ s art had been to be : &quot; I like how to understand life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care to fully compreh@@ end the Bible , but also chosen for him most important , also mysti@@ cal subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar AL@@ T@@ s Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already at the end .
om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured per@@ sever@@ ance , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway .
thus hill off , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the First Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now present in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further commemor@@ ative break &quot; with the work in the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football is respon@@ ding to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy its help in cop@@ ing with the pending problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Soccer League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
at this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Head Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes every day , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football states , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of tremendous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German government provides 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .

reports : SAP CEO loses an eye on accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ached , he has gone out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally collap@@ sed .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football league in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its root elf to the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of master keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability it will also deny the second match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researcher Re@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be the target for the BV@@ B in the Europa League : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ autos : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological leader after the will of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , which also come together with representatives from the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport also empha@@ sizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast conversion to digital radio communications .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tried for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks will be applied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use an international level that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to make use of a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ een the human being as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to the study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , cordless vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday announced that only eight per cent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars are going through in the coming ten years , 32 percent are only expected in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed by 2025 were reck@@ oned with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the highway they could imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .
good every fourth would leave the car the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current state of the title , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to only strike in sing@@ les from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to take the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf said during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ ler in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world rank @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his oeu@@ vre on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins that look very human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant of Haute c@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially dist@@ ressing attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was operated : in order to refres@@ h the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially committed .
according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material went to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the October festival there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interests strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ous fashionable walking attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said G@@ aul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ um tip as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example in blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the j@@ acks .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point , fashion played a major role , then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now being discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is based on past styles , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover is broken away .
there are almost no private shops and wholes@@ alers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is driven almost exclusively by chains .
also we@@ aker export , currently in Russia and in the United States .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer has explained by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal that demonstrates that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Extra@@ ordinary of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this needs time and courage .
there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small cu@@ cum@@ bers at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ter Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze nothing . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball tip for their jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the subject of plau@@ sibility - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want to remember .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it &apos;s not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming but a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI urged to open the economy wider to the world
the economy has to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new spin and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of Mel@@ des@@ ystems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified that are not in question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since it assign@@ s the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing an open @-@ law business environment and designed the market open , said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the session , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the limit of mercury in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans shar@@ ply : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on to pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are so heavily loaded with mercury today that on the basis of the still current limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de dist@@ rac@@ tion man@@ eu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched over the food chain in particular in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
