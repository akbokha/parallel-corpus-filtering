&quot; II ) Inter@@ est information on nuclear material , which is subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , may be published on the decision of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected countries or the community , as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected . &quot;
&quot; a ) When carrying out securing measures in accordance with this Convention , the technological development in the area of securing measures is fully charged , and all efforts are made to ensure optimal cost effectiveness and the use of the principle of effective hed@@ ging monitoring of the flow of nuclear material , which is subject to certain strategic points by using instruments and other technical procedures , as far as the current or future technology is possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) To guarantee the optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following methods are applied as means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the verification process on the phases of the fuel cycle , which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core explosive materials , and the greatest possible restriction of the verification procedure with other core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) In accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organization shall be granted to the effective implementation of the safety measures pursuant to this Convention Information on Nu@@ clear Materials , the Safety Measures , and on the characteristics of the systems involved in carrying out the securing measures concerning this material of bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data which is compatible with carrying out its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment is limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of securing measures relating to core material that is subject to the safety measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In the request of the community , the organization is ready to check asset data that considers the community to be particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not need the organisation to be materi@@ ally over@@ looked , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) The Organization takes the consent of the Community and the States for the designation of insp@@ ectors for the States .
&quot; II ) Provi@@ des the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against a given name , the organization of the Community and States pro@@ poses one or more alternative ben@@ ch@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the repeated ref@@ usal of the Community , to appro@@ ve the nam@@ ing of insp@@ ectors of the organization , the Council shall design@@ ate the ref@@ usal after the General Director of the Organization - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; the General Director &quot; - with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the insp@@ ectors of the organization can actually fulfil their duties according to their Convention .
( C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection ;
( II ) The protection of industrial secrets and other the insp@@ ectors of the Organisation for knowledge of familiar information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as their insp@@ ectors and other officials , the provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material when the Community and the Organization find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activities , which is under the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization in accordance with this Convention the transfer of core material from the states which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material as soon as the receiving state , as provided in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization performs documents from which each passing on , and if necessary , the re @-@ application of the backup measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the community agre@@ es with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated following this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material will not be used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the backup policies in accordance with this Convention for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organisation and the community shall make a provision that the backup measures provided in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures provided in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation will be held on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on any passing on such material from this state or of these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; however , it extends only to matters such as tempor@@ al and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or one under sec@@ rec@@ y @-@ related knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the use of the material material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the carrying out of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se these costs unless they have clari@@ fied beforehand in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are demanded by the insp@@ ectors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States make sure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , on the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same way as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against damage - with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident arising from the carrying out of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention shall be regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; after exam@@ ining the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council shall not be able to make sure that no core material that has to be subject to safety measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons must be rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes , and may also take the other measures designated there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was achieved by the applied backup measures , provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the organization , the community or a state , consult@@ ations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to search for questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected State to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; if any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention , shall be laid down upon request of a party to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , the organization also names two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , and the four appointed arbit@@ rat@@ ors elect a fifth who will lead the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the States or the Organization are not named two arbit@@ rat@@ ors after the application for an arbit@@ r@@ ator , the community or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if thirty @-@ three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ r@@ ator of the fifth refer@@ ee has not yet been elected .
a majority of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are in@@ competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall be conven@@ ed for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
( II ) When the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply their backup policies to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states seek each other upon request of one of the Parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the Organisation , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall inform all Member States of the Organization immediately of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States maintains the written notification that their procedures for entry into force have been completed .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Contract .
the expression used in this agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and the Protocol together .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I as required .
the aim of the process of securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ent of such devi@@ ation by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the submission of the target determined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial inputs and observation as important compl@@ ementary measures . &quot;
the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organization takes place by an explanation in which the material quantity is not given for a certain period of time under specification of accuracy limits for specified amounts .
&quot; when carrying out their tests , the organization makes it possible after article 3 full use of the safety system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their backup measures , the community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and serve ex@@ pe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of existing , manufactured , lost , lost or in other way out of the stock away from the stock and the stocks ; &quot;
B ) evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of measuring uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure to determine , review and evaluate differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure to assess accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) Method to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) initi@@ ates ur@@ anium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet been reached under the letter C ) in the States , so the community of the organisation shares the amount and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 11 . if the provisions set out in Article 11 are not permitted , the community is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organization and the community shall consult each other via the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the backup policies following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material when it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ opic concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation release core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , from these coll@@ ateral measures , provided the entire core material quantity delivered to the states at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special cob@@ alt material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; liber@@ ated core material along with core material , which is subject to the safety measures pursuant to this Convention , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for re @-@ application of securing measures are made on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organization of supplementary agreements , which are required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organization in accordance with this Convention , in particular as the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplements can be extended or changed without amend@@ ment to this Agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report adopted in Article 62 , the organization presents a summar@@ ized inventory of all the core materials contained in the States , ir@@ respective of its origin , and continues this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of its veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organization ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ per@@ ed by general resi@@ due problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the Central Bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table , which is clear in what manner they intended to apply the criteria established in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization organiz@@ es a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Edi@@ fic@@ tional Account &quot; , &quot; which is derived from the funds to the member states in accordance with this agreement with the special editorial account ; this account is governed by the organization as a st@@ ew@@ ard and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; ) , and only for the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or inde@@ fin@@ ite bonds of the member state , which are paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special action account and depos@@ ited at the establishment of the organization in the respective country . &quot;
B ) The payment takes place in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at any other date agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual bud@@ get@@ ary plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the forem@@ en@@ tioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional pulling on the cash or the school j@@ ars to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compens@@ ate for the special action account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the administrator can be derived from the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity for bor@@ rowing conditions without dis@@ advantage ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special transaction is aimed at financing a clearly out@@ dated and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a s@@ ect@@ oral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are regarded , approved , approved and managed for the objectives of the organization , with the aim of the am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special action account must not be used instead of a subordin@@ ate means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the bank or the organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special payments are subject to the same terms of withdrawal , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ undable at ten years of free years . &quot;
special payments are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this clock are directly paid to the organization they retain .
&quot; any special loan agreement must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special transaction can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services , which are established res@@ p . ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and according to the measure of what the administrator has determined at the time of loan granted , recipients of a special transaction could be . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special payments are based on the special action account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective Member State . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC until the complete publication of all the Special Edi@@ tions issued by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs authorised by the directors .
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the E@@ EC teaches quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expenses involved for this . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker convey@@ s the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special action account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special action account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator has created and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special action account , which are based on the deb@@ ts to financial obligations that are paid to the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the complete edition of the Special Edi@@ tions account , lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special action account , the progression of programs or projects financed by special actions , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may agree , do not enter into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be concluded with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States notify the Council of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General condu@@ cts these notes together with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the named notification in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two sig@@ natur@@ es in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding equally author@@ it@@ ative . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ ATION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the territory of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EUROP@@ EAN ( Eur@@ atom ) , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; and DIE SCH@@ WEI@@ Z@@ ER@@ IS@@ CHE Eid@@ genossen@@ schaft , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large trial facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation of a common company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is concerned , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement , to sum up their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable each party to be able to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping through a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties receive a new programme , this will appear in the place of the programs listed in App@@ endix I and II . &quot;
associations agreed in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; in view of carrying out the association designated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and corporations or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom is concerned with the same objective that Switzerland is involved with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s common agreement with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become a contractual partner of any contract whose objective is in the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies assigned to carry out the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
&quot; the Association Agreement shall , in particular , apply to the establishment of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and to direct the best possible outcomes in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by most two delegates in the connection group used within the scope of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG &quot; - represented .
&quot; in order to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , this task is true of all research and development activities referring to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated bodies and establishes their T @-@ level in the interests of both parties on the common objective in the Eur@@ atom program and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the scope of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the coun@@ selling groups , which the VG research proposals , with regard to suggest@@ ing that the resources approved for the Eur@@ atom program take the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and that is responsible for the fact that the capacities of laboratories involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , conc@@ eal this task with regard to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
it provides especially for the best possible use of personnel and for exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mitt@@ ees used within the scope of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees , which provide the best possible use of the resources , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is one of the core and energy research responsible for each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request by the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any amend@@ ments in the align@@ ments as well as for the preparation of the future programs and defining their overall scope , the coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the comments of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mitt@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG for the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two parties are working on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purpose of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount , which corresponds to the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same relation as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the common company as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland has transferred J@@ ET to the Common company J@@ ET , which is determined according to the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company . &quot;
the contribution of the Eur@@ atom to finance the work in the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel sharing is calculated on the same basis which normally serves to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out due to the relevant contracts .
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses within the scope of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year . &quot;
the Commission will pay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .

&quot; the BIS could conclude a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks make an appropriate application . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of € 2.@@ 725 billion . this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member states . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions were listed below , for whose application the BIS would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each of the stand@@ by credit , the BIS would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extending extensions , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as with their possible extension , the BIS would charge a credit @-@ opening vision . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing should not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS , at the time , applied to business under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS has to obtain the necessary means even on the market , the rate of interest for the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the corresponding margin increased li@@ bor . &quot;

&quot; considering the following reasons : the agreement made by UNESCO on the import of objects educational , scientific or cultural character - the so @-@ called agreement of Florence - is intended to promote free circulation of books , publications and objects of educational , scientific or cultural character . &quot;
&quot; on the 19th Conference of the General Conference of the UNESCO of 26 November 1976 , a protocol relating to the agreement of Florence was assumed to allow customs clearance for a number of objects which were excluded as a supplement to the agreement as a separate agreement signed by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; subject to the use of the possibilities offered by number 16 letter a ) , the provisions of the protocol agree with the aims of the European Economic Community . it is therefore advisable to appro@@ ve this protocol using the explanations provided in number 16 ( letter a ) - &quot;

&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community brings - without prejudi@@ ce to the legal acts , which it later en@@ closes - no expansion of the exclusive responsibilities of the community . &quot;
&quot; due to the particular situation of Greenland , with regard to the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exemp@@ ted from the scope of the Convention . &quot;

in the realization that wild animals in their numerous manifest@@ ations represent an irre@@ plac@@ eable part of the natural system of the earth and to be preserved for the benefit of humanity ;
&quot; in the consciousness that every human generation is ad@@ ministered and committed to the Earth &apos;s natural resources for the coming generations , it is committed to ensuring that this legacy is kept and where it is used to use it in a pru@@ dent way ; &quot;
&quot; remember the growing value of wild animals from environmentally @-@ based , ecological , genetic , scientific , aesthetic , free @-@ time @-@ based , cultural , educational , social and economic point of view ; &quot;

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and the demand for trade negotiations at its meeting between 11 and 12 April 1979 , expressed desire to arrive at a uniform version of an agreement to carry out Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement , &quot;
in view of the fact that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet come into effect - I
1 . submit the provisions of Article 1 ( 2 b ) of the Convention ;
2 . notice that the adv@@ ancement of the application of this agreement should be insufficient for developing countries by five years in accordance with Article 21 paragraph 1 in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a development country , the contracting party may apply for an extension of this period before exp@@ iry of the period mentioned in Article 21 paragraph 1 , whereby the contracting parties have such an application in cases where the developing country can provide good reasons , ben@@ evol@@ ent ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . recogni@@ zing that developing countries currently conducting customs valu@@ ation on the basis of official minimum values , if necessary make a reservation in order to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions for which the contracting parties agree to retain ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . recogni@@ zing that developing countries , which are of the opinion , the revers@@ al of the order of application based on Article 4 can cause actual difficulties to make the wish to make the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot;
&quot; the Government of : ... reserves the right to prescri@@ be that the relevant provision of Article 4 applies only , if the customs authorities grant the application for application of Articles 5 and 6 in reverse order . &quot;
&quot; developing countries such reservations , the contracting parties give this reservation in accordance with Article 23 of their consent ; &quot;

&quot; it is the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the Convention relating to the implementation of Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agre@@ ements , as well as other governments which join this Convention by Article 22 , to accept by signing or in another form . &quot;
in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with lamb and lamb
&quot; I ad@@ here to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of lamb , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or ch@@ illed rab@@ bit - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following yearly volume : 20,000 tons , expressed in batt@@ le@@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina must ins@@ ist through appropriate procedures that the actual quantity did not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to conventional proposal forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree on each other before introducing such a change in the Committee listed under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community accepts the protection cl@@ ause , it is oblig@@ ated to bear concern for the fact that the access to Argentina in this agreement is not affected by the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restri@@ ct de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement to a figure of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount stated under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the entry contract , the loading charges for these new Member States will be taken into account under the number 5 called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ech@@ st Set of Ex@@ haus@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23 000 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community adop@@ ts everything in order to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an slu@@ dge and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of ven@@ ison conditions on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation of the Argent@@ ine@@ an slu@@ dge and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sements or other funding measures for the export of lamb and lamb , as well as for the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the amounts specified in this agreement are granted for the quantities specified under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community oblig@@ es itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the gran@@ ting of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the presentation of a export license which is assigned by the Argent@@ inian government designated place . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit can be dispens@@ ed for the gran@@ ting of the import license for the ques@@ tion@@ able products .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I ad@@ here to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep farming and export@@ ing of slu@@ dge and lamb after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy must not be com@@ promised , I ad@@ ore myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or ch@@ illed rab@@ bit - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount established in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of its mam@@ mot@@ h and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand under@@ takes to ensure that the amount that actually did not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the fixed quantities are carried out in conventional packages ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand is not to be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments , or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties will consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned in cl@@ ause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community accepts the protection cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restri@@ ct de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products contained by this agreement to a 10 v.@@ H. AD val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts set in cl@@ ause 2 to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the entry contract ; this shall be taken into account in cl@@ ause 5 of the testi@@ cles of exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 is fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 245 500 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development which could affect the normal paragraph of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb me@@ ats on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks to frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of this goal . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creative workers in the community without risk of market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sements or other funding measures for the export of lamb and lamb , as well as for the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
&quot; the Community oblig@@ es itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand depends on the presentation of a export license , which is granted by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit can be dispens@@ ed for the gran@@ ting of the import license for the ques@@ tion@@ able products .
&quot; in implementing regulations , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent Ne@@ use@@ able Authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals stipul@@ ates the amounts for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted in accordance with destination country . &quot;
the Committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the mam@@ mot@@ h , lamb , and goat meat market of both parties and on the global market , as well as sales conditions on these markets , including conditions that are of significance for the objective of cl@@ ause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee is concerned that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from sp@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers following the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all issues relating to the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stipul@@ ated in cl@@ ause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount pay@@ able by the entry into force on 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total amount of the year .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and on the one hand and for the main area of New Zealand on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each contracting party to cancel it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be veri@@ fied by both parties before 1 April 1984 . &quot;
&quot; I honor myself , if your government can agree with the upcoming agreement that this letter and your reply letter together form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;

&quot; C ) which are not free from trans@@ f@@ usions transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood sampling is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle in which anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ elled before ster@@ il@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; after the ble@@ eding is finished , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution cannot exceed 220 ml per litre of human thorough@@ bred , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined before the blood cells and the ser@@ um . determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by exam@@ ining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .

&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ ular of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ per sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or equivalent comparison of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen T , the ser@@ um should be able to react with blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are designed to use object gir@@ ders in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons that are immun@@ ized by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with the floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these ser@@ a are therefore specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are em@@ bos@@ sed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ cd@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D may contain ) must show a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons that are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and must not be contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ized persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D using anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies refer to the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ations@@ zeit of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the anti@@ body antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ized by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ b and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative agent , separated with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object bearing with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ perc@@ enti@@ ally flus@@ hing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in every in@@ und@@ ation within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the recur@@ rent but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ ate of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ized by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ative agent , to ti@@ tr@@ ate with a flus@@ hing of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on one object bearing with equal quantity of a 5@@ - to 10@@ perc@@ enti@@ ally flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the recur@@ rent but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard prepar@@ ate of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating anti@@ body against compl@@ ementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ized by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s in@@ scription , it does not ent@@ ail any un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong to . &quot;

the tr@@ ades linked to the goods transport between the contracting parties are fu@@ elled by means of a single paper to use the repro@@ ofs according to the patterns in Anne@@ x I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the uni@@ formity wizard serves as application or paper for export@@ ing , for shipping or import@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legal provisions applicable in a contractual party , whose application would not be guaranteed with sole use of the sole paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to be demanded by the parties , so that they can come to the enjoyment of a benefit or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the contracting parties , simplified procedures , even under the use of data processing , with regard to further relief for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Th@@ rough procedures can be fores@@ een in particular , that the goods concerned must not be presented at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete application may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , a registration must be made subsequently , with the consent of the competent authorities for a peri@@ odic collective agreement , within which deadline specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 may be allowed , instead of using the sole paper trading sp@@ ap@@ iere . &quot;
&quot; if the uni@@ formity wizard is used , the parties involved with the consent of the competent authorities will be able to join all the lists associated with the export and import of supplements in the trade common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;
