this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. entertaining thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and wei@@ rd occurr@@ ences ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have an ab@@ normal epis@@ odes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied or the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets applied in patients to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets trou@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less extent acts as neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; because dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alising the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms to be less@@ ened and their recur@@ rence is prevented . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies of up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the alter@@ ation of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body res@@ or@@ b@@ ates the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased ease than patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; furthermore , A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was ad@@ ministered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ c@@ asses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ al disturb@@ ances ( un@@ controlled inf@@ usion ) , ac@@ ath@@ isie ( nau@@ sea ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and fatigue , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturb@@ ances ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ auses ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes were referred to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted the inclusion of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes were referred to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day independently of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ es over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ c@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher su@@ ici@@ dal risk of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions , which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ity , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acceler@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with an A@@ bili@@ fy treat symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms associated with a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with con@@ vul@@ sions in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or for conditions associated with con@@ vul@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an elevated risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a trial with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ics and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; because of the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , cau@@ tion is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines associated with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist family , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy subjects a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should predomin@@ ate potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be ad@@ ministered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation in humans and due to the concerns incur@@ red in the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below depends on the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; Schizophr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total decreased inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients taking plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( creat@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ omatic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ lo@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and var@@ ic@@ ism , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch of the market , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was observed in adult patients with estimated dos@@ es of up to 1260 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is beneficial , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma image binding . &quot;
it is susp@@ ected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vit@@ ro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ es of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recept@@ or lig@@ ands , at Nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der respon@@ dents who had a response to study medication were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; actual values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ mine Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ sr@@ ate scale showed significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the recur@@ rence rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia versus 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I incident , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior effect compared to plac@@ ebo for reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ es with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a positive effect compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mpt@@ omatic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before Rand@@ om@@ isation showed themselves to plac@@ ebo superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar resi@@ due , mainly in prevention of a recur@@ rence in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ profil@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ mination of Eli@@ mination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and close 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pug@@ o class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the ero@@ geneous potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ al rin@@ ds @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle from monkeys to repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vit@@ ro solu@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical max. dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once a day independently of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may use the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the inci@@ dence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after altern@@ ating an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the medicine ( * ) :
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I incident , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior effect compared to plac@@ ebo for reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is susp@@ ected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia versus 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ es with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I incident Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study compared to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 In addition a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle from monkeys to repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical max. dose . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution is used to quickly control A@@ gi@@ tier@@ dness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under enc@@ ro@@ achment of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy mel@@ ting tabl@@ etten or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions , which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ity , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acceler@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ics and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time intr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly one and which received at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intr@@ am@@ us@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after all@@ a gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects occur more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or have been classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below depends on the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently than plac@@ ebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients taking plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was reduced to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( creat@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ omatic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their appearance also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ism , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements in det@@ achment / behavi@@ oral disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement in symptoms with regard to plac@@ ebo and similar to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement from the initial value to the PAN@@ SS Exc@@ it@@ ement Com@@ ponent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe as@@ cul@@ tation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a decreased patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der respon@@ dents who had a response to study medication was similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; actual values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ sr@@ ate scale showed significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the recur@@ rence rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group , and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia versus 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a total of 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo , mainly in preventing a recur@@ rence in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection ; the system@@ ic exposition was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies for re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after intrav@@ en@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns about mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the ero@@ geneous potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ al rin@@ ds @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times of middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle from monkeys to repeti@@ tive oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical max. dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole use or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 women who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
patients who were treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer have no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time and deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer were shown in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
patients may also not be used in patients that have low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was involved in patients , where the first treatment would no longer be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs there must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission informed the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited approval for transport@@ ing Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease is not shown and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sen@@ sor@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , treatment is interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles artic@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which may have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sy@@ mpt@@ omatic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated until the ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ur@@ ic count increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l again . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly identified kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indic@@ ative patient collective are not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if it occurs in patients following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ ics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women , who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
&quot; during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women should use a reliable feeding method . &quot;
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to testi@@ fy during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm production since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the safety and the ability to operate machines .
&quot; below are the most frequent and most important inci@@ dents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most noticeable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; Leu@@ cop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of the patients .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ u@@ bul@@ i active substance which promotes the inter@@ lac@@ ing of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bular indi@@ mers and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ pol@@ ari@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recept@@ or and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ ine protein aci@@ dic rich in cy@@ steine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of the tum@@ our .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ handed un@@ blind studies and 454 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer performed every 3 weeks with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el either in the form of free @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for falling on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute mark@@ ings of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
the drug exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 167@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intrav@@ en@@ ous gift from Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 632 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points to a far @-@ reaching extr@@ av@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intrav@@ en@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) according to Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue chi@@ ves is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast canc@@ ers , the mean value for cum@@ ulative secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic type 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment , to ensure that no iron defici@@ ency exists , and iron supplements should be ad@@ ministered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine defici@@ ency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from ana@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ sent in the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from ana@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as with those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed &apos;s most common side effect is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ se@@ amed has provided proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that provides Ab@@ se@@ amed is provided for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
August 2007 the European Commission granted to the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ ütter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for placing Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

&quot; the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with planned larger operative procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;

&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may differ depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exce@@ eds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling ana@@ emia and ana@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance dos@@ es than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance dos@@ es than patients , in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intrav@@ en@@ ous application if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may differ depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ coefficient of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value around ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number increased ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ ids around &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood samples is needed , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program started , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug into circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin to er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be ab@@ sent or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk of deep v@@ ein thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ que ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a major or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in the following first@@ - , esc@@ ort or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with short heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , subsequent acid or vitamin B@@ 12 defici@@ ency , aluminium poison@@ ing , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the ana@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / mic@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers should be determined and if no other reason of an active loss occurs , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be studied for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic stim@@ ulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the administration of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of ana@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tum@@ our patients with chemotherapy , Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should evaluate a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exce@@ eds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic ana@@ emia ) to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic ana@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk @-@ weighing under the involvement of the patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger medical orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , the cause of ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients that under@@ go a major or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in case of treatment with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa for patients with an initial pH value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tum@@ our patients with sy@@ mpt@@ omatic ana@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that received chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ do sis should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies at tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , cer@@ eb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , cer@@ eb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , cer@@ eb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients suffering from ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .

survival and tum@@ our progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients with ana@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of an@@ thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ our patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the veri@@ fied data . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa regulations following repeated intrav@@ en@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the Ser@@ um Mirror of Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors that can be reached after intrav@@ en@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the Ser@@ um mirrors remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ cs or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fi@@ bro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( which were not treated with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approxim@@ ate the twenty @-@ fold of the recommended weekly dose , Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa caused a dimin@@ ished frag@@ ile body weight , to a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and a rise in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
these reports are based on vit@@ ro findings with cells of human tum@@ our tissue samples which are of in@@ secure Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation .
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , Ab@@ se@@ amed can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so if necessary , the dimensions of sub@@ sets are possible . &quot;
the Ab@@ se@@ amed treatment has to be conducted under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

• In a month before your treatment you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from an un@@ stable Ang@@ ina P@@ ect@@ oris ( first appearing or reinforced chest pain ) - if you have previously encountered such a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age in the v@@ eins ( deep v@@ ein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) .
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripher@@ al arter@@ ial disease ) , the cer@@ vi@@ cal arter@@ ial ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dos@@ cope @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which forms again during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests in order to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron defici@@ ency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or subsequent acid defici@@ ency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the beginning of the therapy . &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ie after a month to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( below the skin mol@@ ded ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie , he will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intrav@@ en@@ ous ) if you are treated because of ana@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of ster@@ il@@ isation could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or offensive calibration , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium values are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for evalu@@ ating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ y al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you are o@@ bes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past has already occurred an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mb@@ ose or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , before the start of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , the cause of your ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of ble@@ eding after surgery is possible . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines , or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means to build the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) addresses the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ glo@@ at value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular dos@@ es of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed across two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ glo@@ at value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; depending on how the ana@@ emia is referred to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe was taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used or dis@@ car@@ ded within 3 days . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minimal hip frac@@ ture such as falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or through injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years that had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; in case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % for patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients taking plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors willing to prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
April 2005 the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures including patients with a recently developed low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • Con@@ train@@ dic@@ ation in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When accessing medical or nursing assistance &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture , an initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ales or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a creat@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adol@@ esc@@ ents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age as data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy are missing .
&quot; for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before beginning treatment ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effects of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ omatic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta syndrome ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be treated with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental handles , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence in reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disturb@@ ances which expressed themselves as acceptance of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um creat@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the corneal clearing ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ omatic calcium levels occurred below the normal threshold area ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently released hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion station , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area was beneficial mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 Study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area at one with A@@ cl@@ asta and patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved by applying or@@ alem calcium and / or intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the thig@@ h neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ ral body .
effects on morph@@ ometric ver@@ teb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta demonstrated a constant effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density effect ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % increase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hips by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone structure .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 up to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total frac@@ tures and scar@@ ves at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % on the bill .
clinical effectiveness in men in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta in comparison to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at referred to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta has been examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically substanti@@ ated , especially mild to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
&quot; with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma label quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid organic dis@@ appearance from the great cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values mentioned above ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the ad@@ ministered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; reduced clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes , met@@ aboli@@ zed substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ versible , met@@ abolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the creat@@ ine in Clear@@ ance , and amoun@@ ted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a creat@@ ine @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
&quot; because for severe kidney failure ( creat@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al acting intrav@@ en@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single dos@@ es of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6 times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , ad@@ ministered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; Sub@@ chronic and Chr@@ onic Tox@@ ic@@ ity In trials with intrav@@ en@@ ous application was measured the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , by dos@@ es of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( an cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 8th of the human therapeutic exposure , referred to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as intrav@@ en@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the most common efficacy in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ sis of long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ es , a finding and which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such as skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the time of preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine for risk management systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the safety of the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather grad@@ ual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone structure is too fast and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered , which makes the bone @-@ material we@@ aker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta has been norm@@ alized by normal bone renovation , ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to under@@ go a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines / apply or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs , of which is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you can take sufficient liquid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is ad@@ ministered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is ad@@ ministered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta has a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood after inf@@ usion .
&quot; in case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please check your nearest doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , appear within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effects of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mpt@@ omatic running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in accordance with at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traumatic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ales or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia uses a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been carried out in more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on setting the smoking , on the other hand , showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the trials ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of upper respiratory tissue . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and among other things , a small minority of patients can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; cau@@ tion is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN &quot;
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with o@@ besity or over@@ weight cuts

&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of o@@ besity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors ng , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years due to lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the use of the treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides the o@@ besity - are not liable to any percep@@ tible risks , de@@ press@@ ant reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearest persons ) are indicated that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ amine or ins@@ ulin , the existing dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ amine or ins@@ ulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ amine or ins@@ ulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , thereby improving type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in case of more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in this case patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ amine , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos has led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glu@@ cose levels are reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ amine in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the addition of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and Insul@@ in was examined in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin had a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ana@@ esthes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to permit Ac@@ tos to operate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with ins@@ ulin , and with which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or sy@@ mpt@@ omatic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed to signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but what did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with elevated output liver enzy@@ matic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is elevated to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach up@@ grading , fatigue , loss of appe@@ tite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the laboratory parameters are pres@@ i@@ ded by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be stir@@ red from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , a s@@ lower reduction of moderate hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ specialist or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market , thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ cons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but cor@@ rup@@ ting doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate oph@@ thal@@ mic clari@@ fication should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ year in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes pregnancy or initi@@ ation , the treatment is to be removed ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for investig@@ ating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant impacts on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ction ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the uter@@ ine decre@@ ases and thus decre@@ ases the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from available data not valued ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ ret and the index of the lens as they can also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege beha@@ ved more often than plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market , it is rarely reported about con@@ ges@@ tive failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; during the trial period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the high dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to have an activation of specific key recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glu@@ cose level in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de versus Mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three month optimi@@ zing phase with ins@@ ulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.45 % , compared with the patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin treatment in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study on type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ tic@@ u@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups that received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ orted , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is roughly three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and to a l@@ esser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the middle plasma elim@@ ination period of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance resem@@ ble themselves . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys consistent after repeated administration plasma volume increase with hem@@ ost@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and re@@ versible exc@@ ent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one that reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother animal and thus decre@@ ases the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder are induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indicators led to an increased frequency of col@@ oni@@ um . &quot;

the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ year in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de , were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the goal in terms of their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation section above the an@@ kl@@ es , cor@@ on@@ ary r@@ il@@ li@@ zation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , suggest the results suggest that taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is not associated with cardiovascular long@@ term risks . &quot;

&quot; in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as cannot produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , showing how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been lo@@ wered considerably as with another human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the dos@@ es of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list in the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ wei@@ gh the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to appro@@ ve acet@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , if a fast initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood glu@@ cose attitude has improved significantly , for example by an intensive ins@@ ulin therapy , can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia sy@@ mpt@@ omatic changes and should be consul@@ ted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long acting ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin of animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling with several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken in other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them .

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hydr@@ ate glu@@ cose can be treated by oral intake of glu@@ cose or sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , sweets , bis@@ cuits , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias are treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cose ( 0,5 to 1,0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glu@@ cose , which is given intrav@@ en@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the total time period is up to 24 hours . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( p@@ ains and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , patients with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic have to take further medicines for the prevention of toxic waste at least during the first six months . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ es ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ lamp medicine ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily received 120 m@@ g. a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history may also involve increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present g@@ lowing no@@ des and / or a poly@@ arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ ness seal after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration every day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney imp@@ air@@ ments , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; for children and adol@@ esc@@ ents there is no experience in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience in organ transplan@@ t , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
car@@ dio Vas@@ cular Diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ compens@@ ated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , it can occur during the course of the treatment , because through the reduction of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid acid , urine deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far rise that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies have observed mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o treatment and in further course depending on clinical findings and a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war has not been carried out of interactions to f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is well known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line levels ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous donation of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 times a day with a rise in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without ne@@ eding any dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC tested a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide contains , the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delays and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of ex@@ pon@@ ed pregn@@ ancies can not be closed on the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies can not be concluded directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or at the exercise of hazardous activities until they can reasonably be confident that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of car@@ dio @-@ related events reported by the D@@ UT was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol Group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors found in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 bis &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and the ( test specim@@ ens ) in total more than once were reported are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * Clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these dos@@ es or with a l@@ esser frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ d@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ an@@ esthes@@ ia , hypo@@ critical E@@ KG , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin irrit@@ ation , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , les@@ ions , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes in blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease of the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reactions of hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ a acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ pur@@ in sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ in@@ hibition which lies beneath the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly certain ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot;
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) for patients with a ser@@ um creat@@ ine value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional dos@@ es of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments of 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were combined for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of ser@@ um har@@ ness to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney imp@@ air@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decrease of ser@@ um har@@ ness concentrations in subjects , ir@@ respective of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ by concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid levels indicated to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the inci@@ dence of toxic waste ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ out ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the density node @-@ size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at are sim@@ pler and multiple dos@@ es of 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally . &quot;
dos@@ es between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ ing@@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking simple or multi@@ functional dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline of ser@@ um har@@ ness concentration was observed , provided that this has been checked ( multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma elim@@ ination of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is achieved with dos@@ es of 80 and 120 m@@ g. &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ C8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction To intake Multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pug@@ o Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate @-@ severe ( Child @-@ Pug@@ o Classi@@ fication A ) or metabol@@ ites were not significant compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after intake of multiple oral dos@@ es of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold of exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and ur@@ inary composition and not considered relevant for clinical application .
it was noted that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral dos@@ es of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high dos@@ es , which were approxim@@ ate for the 4 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity arose , accompanied by lowering the capacity and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions which have approximately the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which have approximately the thir@@ teenth of the human therapeutic exposure , did not give any ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects . &quot;

&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * Clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly certain ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot;
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid levels indicated to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the inci@@ dence of toxic waste ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ out ) .

&quot; the holder of approval for placing on the market has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and so long available how the drug is brought to transport . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is present in accordance with CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine to risk management systems for Medic@@ inal Products with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available , which have an impact on safety data , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • upon request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ solu@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the harm@@ less concentration by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC low , the cryst@@ all@@ isation is prevented and thus with time a reduction of the dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , • if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart disease or suffer or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated with a high degree of ur@@ ic acid or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden emergence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , warmth and joint sw@@ elling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is de@@ duc@@ ted before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to happen at all , but could also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint sw@@ elling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines , or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you can inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine / use one of the following substances as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ c@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for treating as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for treating as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood dil@@ lu@@ tion in heart diseases )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on transport and the ability to operate machinery .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in medicines , which are approved in the European Union , the Company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , p@@ ains of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive apparatus such as stomach aches , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , gast@@ ul@@ ence ( ble@@ eding ) , gast@@ ul@@ ence ( ble@@ eding ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as su@@ cking up . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ aller@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after rising of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ es is made . • The patient should not take place before the first dietary intake of the day that should take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract apart from p@@ yl@@ oric acid , only be given below special cau@@ tion ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ es and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( sometimes this severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the physician should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms indicated on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that are not taking the medicine correctly and / or , after the appearance of symptoms indicated on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly intrav@@ en@@ ously given bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients requiring a lo@@ wered surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients need to be instruc@@ ted that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ tis ) should also be adequ@@ ately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before commen@@ cement of treatment .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies have not been carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at have no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy that recogni@@ zes embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , ser@@ um @-@ calcium decreased up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light , via the transformation of 7 Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ught to Vitamin D3 . &quot;
&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ meth@@ amine D3 is increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a defici@@ ency can lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ cs , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus to a further increased risk of falls and bone frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic persons . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture inci@@ dence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 944 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.6 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of ver@@ teb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , continued to either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intrav@@ en@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in women 0.64 % for dos@@ es between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.46 % and 0.39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standar@@ dised breakfast .
oste@@ opor@@ osis was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clinical significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed according to intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg temporarily , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ ination After intrav@@ en@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance marked within 72 hours with urine has ex@@ cre@@ ted and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; after intrav@@ en@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not dischar@@ ged via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by means of these transport systems . &quot;

the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ rans@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ amine D3 , and then met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1,25 @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ meth@@ amine D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; the mean separation of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the percentage of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is present , it is nevertheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is ad@@ ministered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the Company has presented the results from previously conducted trials with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was canc@@ eled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , diabetes , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased pot@@ assium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension , as well as ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f because the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gel@@ at@@ ine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule part with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sel@@ ette with &quot; precau@@ tionary 647 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; because of clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including sub @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ spiegel should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the system@@ ic exposition , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ spiegel are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post@@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be ad@@ ministered intrav@@ en@@ ously ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection must maintain immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dos@@ ages may be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from daily dos@@ ages of Pro@@ graf Cap@@ sules to one once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f so this conversion is in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take place in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral and liver transplan@@ t recommended oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis should begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transc@@ ei@@ ver patients although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ le and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function in order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cholesterol level , a calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ese and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy cau@@ tion is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the dam in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ spiegel control .
&quot; it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after re@@ conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ adaptation , modifications of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the seb@@ um in the blood 20 ng / ml will not exceed .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in cardi@@ ac and heart @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentr@@ ates generally were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub @-@ exposure or over @-@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be re@@ frac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions that may lead to a down@@ turn of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the car@@ ob ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedi@@ es during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ graf , a chamber or sep@@ tum / hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturb@@ ances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions caused by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disorders , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; da Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose , is recommended in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special cau@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es known as inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ c@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id Antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of the g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism impacts .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lowers the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid Con@@ az@@ ep@@ tives and thus increases the hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ eption @-@ prevention measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ ging their half @-@ life time .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ tation patients do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants there is increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
&quot; in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ca@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below you will find the side effects following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; because of its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be convey@@ ed through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the compound in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ presses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 recept@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an intermediate analysis over a recently conducted , multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ graf was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Th@@ orac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a study , the inci@@ dence of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ graf was performed in 205 patients who received a random@@ ised procedure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ graf as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabol@@ ism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ graf ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposition of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ graf . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advances to treat ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII defici@@ ency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into which they enable the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated to prevent ble@@ eding as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of advances in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new levels of blood has been &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , m@@ aus@@ al or hamster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for placing Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , according to the location and extent of the blood and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ical events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma bricks ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ections all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the p@@ ains and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
inj@@ ections all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to determine the factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VIII , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be dos@@ ed between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma is not reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the Factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be taken . &quot;
&quot; the dose rate should be directed according to the condition of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known inhibit@@ or@@ development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ pped ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s performed in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 bis &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk ass@@ ess@@ ments as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the registration holder should apply for another extension in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissue ( tissues that connect other structures within the body are sur@@ passed and supported ) of it . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ def@@ ective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to restor@@ ing damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be restored .
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ construction , in bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient is harmful . &quot;
the company did not know whether the withdrawal effects for patients participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are combined so that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other slowly release over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; for treatment of symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , caused by allergi@@ es against poll@@ en caused inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al nas@@ al sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ as is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be carried out on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received the in@@ cis@@ ions reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who alone took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , sleep disturb@@ ances and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; for patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ re@@ adin ( other medicines for treating allergi@@ es ) , should not be used . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from bot@@ t@@ len@@ ose glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ ri@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused by hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for the use of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cr@@ ying , cr@@ ashing or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
it should not be used for children under 12 years of absence due to lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after a decrease in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ ina@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after finishing this therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ zone stro@@ kes such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce the appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients with kidney or liver dysfunction were not checked and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce the appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment at occur@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;

&quot; for at least 48 hours before performing dermat@@ ological tests , an@@ hist@@ amine may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce their size . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were ad@@ ministered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of ana@@ emia during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of affected women , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the inci@@ dence of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ art@@ edness that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic safety or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian dis@@ courses . &quot;

&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring variables , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg a day compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ de or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years were included with seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 414 patients received Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of ne@@ ph@@ in@@ ze tablets with regard to the decre@@ asing effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of in@@ cis@@ ion tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aero@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study performed with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is a bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the use of an in@@ cis@@ ion tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , toxic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , however , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not detect any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in re@@ productive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not included in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg tablets ( solu@@ ble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies during seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the symptom of the symptom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ rel ad@@ ine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for approval of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to evaluate efficacy in adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous condition of the disease and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms and can be res@@ um@@ ed at their recur@@ rence .
in the pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the Aller@@ gen period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were ad@@ ministered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to ligh@@ the@@ art@@ edness that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic safety or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg a day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 y@@ outh@@ ful patients aged 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multiple dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were ad@@ ministered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ il@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ins on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was ad@@ ministered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was ad@@ ministered at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( nine times the clinical dose ) was ad@@ ministered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring variables , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms like Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ oni@@ fying allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the ques@@ tionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decre@@ ases the burden caused by sa@@ ison@@ ale allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can easily be recru@@ ited prosp@@ ectively . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin also results in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the disorder of sleep and growth as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients were compared with the general sa@@ ison@@ als allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no evidence of a clin@@ ically relevant accumulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin not inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gene toxic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exists to support a treatment of an inf@@ ectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical tests and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and experience a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to the met@@ aboli@@ ze normal in children . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or a su@@ cro@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multiple dose study on adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were ad@@ ministered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment were 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the progression of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( nine times the clinical dose ) was used more than ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets lead to no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in clinical trials .
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms like ni@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the ques@@ tionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the caused by sa@@ ison@@ ale allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ functional study with the si@@ ren formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half life of about 120 hours .
there are no evidence of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ accumulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents .
12 In various individual dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were comparable in pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended dos@@ es with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III Bra@@ ke bottles with child safe poly@@ propylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ c can be removed without dam@@ aging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg a day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a multiple dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg a day compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;

immediately before application the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablets are removed without dam@@ aging them .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall inci@@ dence of side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not stop significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional medicine formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at for the decre@@ asing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;

&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple dos@@ es , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms like Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the mel@@ ting tablets revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in children aged 2 to 11 , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are met@@ aboli@@ zed normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group .
&quot; inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine solution , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed . &quot;
the recommended dos@@ es were comparable to the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the ques@@ tionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ j@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the burden caused by sa@@ ison@@ ale allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for import@@ ing the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that au@@ c@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were comparable in pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended dos@@ es with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; following the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the immune system is able to form a rapid anti@@ body in a contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane lining of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a foreign body ) , was dis@@ connected , and used as an integral part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
one survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not studied . &quot;
&quot; v@@ ases should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested , which anti@@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the probability is that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of arom@@ at@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase , in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not to cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; v@@ ast@@ asis was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ trac@@ eable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or alter@@ ation of virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , however , with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; patients with HIV , which were resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ble@@ eding ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are de@@ graded in the same way as amo@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ are take the risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ lifiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of v@@ ast@@ asis in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; v@@ ast@@ asis was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; as at the time of permission for scientific reasons only limited information was available . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approved a permit for transfer@@ ring v@@ ast@@ ases to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be ad@@ ministered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ es of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; hence as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher dos@@ es must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of v@@ ast@@ asis in combination with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use should be done with cau@@ tion in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
v@@ ast@@ asis may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ Enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ epatitis function including chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ oi@@ des , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ression of ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of aden@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who are taking this medicine at the same time may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal sy@@ mpt@@ omes , especially if there are even low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ col@@ o@@ ase of the A@@ ER@@ ase solution , this dosage form is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to their therapy medicines required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical condition or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ se were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term treatment of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ Enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been observed very frequently adverse effects on the liver .
JO@@ HAN@@ N@@ IS@@ KRA@@ UT ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um Mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if one patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the spr@@ inkl@@ ing mirror and , if possible , check the virus @-@ load and susp@@ end the cur@@ rant . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max decre@@ ases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstr@@ ating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to monitor close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and v@@ ases should be at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ ase .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , cau@@ tion is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bricks . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , cau@@ tion is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus resulted in a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with v@@ ast@@ asis in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma bricks of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max from k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ c@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can , if they are used together with gener@@ a , may cause interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with amo@@ gen@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as v@@ ases as it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of the plasma bricks of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; simultaneous intake with v@@ ast@@ asis may significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ate increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ consecutive interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous donation of v@@ ast@@ asis with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in plasma bricks are expected during simultaneous administration of v@@ ast@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of therapeu@@ tical concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of mirrors , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the same time ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore as@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while cau@@ tion is advisable while using as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma bricks from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is ad@@ ministered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal sy@@ mpt@@ omes , especially if there are even low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at present , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with gener@@ a , an increased control of INR ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , so as alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
a careful observation of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ act@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the descendants , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ ER@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and often led to treatment break@@ age . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied if they are associated with taking ag@@ ro@@ chemicals or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and were performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as under the treatment of occur@@ ing laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fast under@@ skin fat tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ udi@@ n / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ udi@@ n over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sticks ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients ( 3 % ) performed in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection , or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and inci@@ dence of adverse reactions ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures should be initiated . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the proc@@ ession of viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein levels with the result of a formation of in@@ mature , non inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in cases of chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ es - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ten treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 71@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 71@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) performed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over 96 weeks including the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
&quot; for gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a gest@@ ed phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( Separ@@ ation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpre@@ t the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cru@@ de resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for the cross resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the retention of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI previously treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to axial bladder , at least one other PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ al v@@ ases is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ened &quot; v@@ ases .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient is fluctu@@ ated during the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be ad@@ ministered with cau@@ tion when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily spr@@ inkl@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a 14 % less bio@@ availability solution than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of kidney dysfunction on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be small . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma cones similar to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the pul@@ ero@@ gen@@ eity of mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ os@@ cell aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither nuts nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and mar@@ g@@ onal skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher dos@@ es must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous use should be done with cau@@ tion in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active ingredients . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max decre@@ ases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to monitor close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ ase .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , cau@@ tion is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ate increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ consecutive interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with gener@@ a , an increased control of INR ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures should be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the retention of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ened &quot; v@@ ases should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing the treatment with PI . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient is fluctu@@ ated during the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be ad@@ ministered with cau@@ tion when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the impact of kidney dysfunction on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be small . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the pul@@ ero@@ gen@@ eity of mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic aden@@ omas with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oz@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither spec@@ kl@@ ess nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabol@@ ites are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; hom@@ eless &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ atic solution to take @-@ in was neither covered with the PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; hence as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of asy@@ n@@ chron@@ ous solution to take and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of asy@@ n@@ chron@@ ous solution for inj@@ ecting patients with kidney failure is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ col@@ o@@ ase , A@@ ER@@ ase is a solution for inf@@ low inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of metabol@@ isation of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with v@@ ast@@ asis , does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active ingredients . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be ab@@ sent in duration if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max decre@@ ases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with v@@ ast@@ asis may significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on data to 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral use of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk of humans is not known . as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied due to potential toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk l@@ act@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied if they are associated with taking ag@@ ro@@ chemicals or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ es - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ten treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
early departure of a fail@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
62 Basic information on this data should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ened &quot; v@@ ases .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to the tissue on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and mar@@ g@@ onal skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; head@@ aches , fatigue , fatigue , disease feeling , v@@ om@@ iting , blo@@ ating skin r@@ ash ( red@@ ness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the skin r@@ ash can be serious nature and force you to break the intake of this drug . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , a fat removal on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast enlargement and li@@ pos@@ u@@ el@@ est in the neck ( &quot; &quot; ch@@ op &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other components are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( Polye@@ th@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , acet@@ yl alcohol , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of case war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is five times a week to apply five times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , cream should be applied thin@@ ly to the affected skin areas so that they remain on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before they are washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients treated with full healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo arm either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ t@@ ine ker@@ ato@@ sis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic dos@@ es ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions restri@@ ct the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time go up and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream should continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be weigh@@ ed if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the les@@ ions are cured in the follow @-@ up procedure 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned , with co@@ war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot;
it should take a look at these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take a consideration between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ Host@@ - reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ ape has been performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis were observed and one case with one for circumcis@@ ion leading t@@ inc@@ ture was observed . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ es , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In sel@@ dom cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation have been observed , which necess@@ it@@ ated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for the treatment of external inci@@ dents in the genital and peripher@@ al area , no clinical experience has yet been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of gra@@ dients in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ vot@@ od @-@ Creme has shown less efficacy in this patient group with regard to elim@@ ination of co@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , lips , or hair attachment was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decre@@ ases during therapy or reactions are back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient , or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there is currently no data available for long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to the i@@ mi@@ vot@@ al therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has not been studied for treating ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip cavity . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the t@@ inc@@ ture ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually take off in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause major dis@@ comfort to the patient , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not cause any direct or indirect det@@ ri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , chil@@ d@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after a unique top@@ ical application has been reached quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of co@@ war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the B@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme in connection with the side effect were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od ) . &quot;
the side effects specified by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with an ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; according to the review plan , the clinical evidence shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , Ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ orted / Ab@@ schu@@ ppen ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review plan , the clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme is very common to severe Er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shock formation and enc@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials for investig@@ ating the application of ion@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis al@@ op@@ ecia was established with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral dos@@ es of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intrav@@ en@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination the system@@ ic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od .
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy based on a complete healing of the inci@@ dents in case of an i@@ mi@@ vot@@ al treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , the inci@@ dents were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI : &quot;
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ vot@@ od treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) treated with plac@@ ebo compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od with five mal@@ ign@@ ant use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that around 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during three weeks of weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical departure after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external inci@@ dents , ac@@ inc@@ i ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies in case studies examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest medication concentrations in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ ched 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 one @-@ ard ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 sach@@ ets ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated semi @-@ value time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medication in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure revealed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged between 6 and 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with an ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ to@@ sis or super @-@ fi@@ brill@@ ary bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four months study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , dos@@ es of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were significantly reduced weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for the same period of four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice by pa@@ edi@@ atric administration on three days a week induced no tum@@ ours at the application site .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to system@@ ic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours appeared in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● Su@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ it@@ als ( sex organs ) and anus ( after ) ● super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to exposure , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
t@@ inc@@ ture kern@@ els are harsh areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their hi@@ ther@@ to life .
&quot; al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only with flat ak@@ t@@ ine ker@@ ato@@ des in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances , which help your body to fight the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection with war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about before you have problems with your immune system . o Do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o W@@ enden the cream not in@@ war@@ dly an@@ . o Do not use any more cream than your doctor prescri@@ . o If reactions to the treated place occur that will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are de@@ duc@@ ted , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , sw@@ elling , fer@@ til@@ isation of the skin or difficulty in with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin can be calculated . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ x ) or within anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medicine for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream after intercourse ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines , or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od enters into the breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and ak@@ inc@@ ture ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of al@@ dar@@ a cream to clean , dry skin with the co@@ war@@ ts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
men with co@@ war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area below ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

tell your doctor / doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin react strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause even faster a blue stain from you or it can cause dro@@ ught .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , it is a lighter skin reaction that will end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , sw@@ elling , sw@@ elling , skin destruction , bladder , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase defici@@ ency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amine og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not de@@ graded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints that complic@@ ate movements , lower lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma should be monitored by a physician that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
&quot; administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the efficacy of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness has been measured ( by exam@@ ining the effect of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be used . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be announced every year , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma regarding the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using a re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eg@@ stock of chin@@ ese HAM@@ STER@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase defici@@ ency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma should be carried out by a physician that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient we@@ ars this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing regim@@ en can be recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing regim@@ en can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should be closely monitored closely , and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with cau@@ tion when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) , to minim@@ ise the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ weight inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not leave immediate or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase via breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms do not satisfy . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly categ@@ or@@ ised as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma that were observed during the phase @-@ 3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ induced involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , there were also severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe progression and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients received a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby it usually occurred within a month to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature failure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not able to detect det@@ ectable antibodies ( RI@@ P ) , including 3 patients , with whom it never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ov@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients with ab@@ normal to low anti@@ body levels showed a robust decrease in the urine levels in the urine , while in patients with high anti@@ body patients a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ oni@@ das activity in vit@@ ro which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulate sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzy@@ matic activity .
&quot; after intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 Phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients received from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma showed an improvement in the lung function and the in@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the body @-@ size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop of the G@@ AG mirror in urine ( µ@@ g / mg of creat@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous causes of disease between the patients , which were taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes of overall FE@@ V ( expected in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder joints AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma were examined in 20 patients ( 16 patients with severe in@@ let form and 4 with medium s@@ lower shape ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased g@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium run @-@ form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress could be detected in cogni@@ tive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks may present in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a justi@@ fiable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to patients affected by older and less severe affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who do not have chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ cell &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the cell &apos;s epithel@@ ial cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( one vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ a and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is ad@@ ministered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin is additionally given an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid defici@@ ency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ appearance changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be raised , decre@@ asing or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural car@@ cin@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study to 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the cell &apos;s epithel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ a for longer survival times than with the comparison medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ a across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each batch cook@@ er has to be released with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the dispens@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ weight plate epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in excess plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is ad@@ ministered as intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is ad@@ ministered as intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids are given .
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 dos@@ es of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the latest P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after every third filling cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood@@ stream should be created before every application , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ ate @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of pre@@ - h@@ itting therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dos@@ es of dos@@ ages , hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over 65 years of age there is an increased side @-@ risk co .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creat@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which are recommended for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a creat@@ ine clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bi limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be ad@@ ministered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ hil count has once again att@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ics , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; less toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ UV toxic@@ ity like ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been accepted if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients are required to be treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ etic lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed on the day of therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this active ingredient was ad@@ ministered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the re@@ productive capacity through P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , men should be pointed out before the treatment centre to obtain advice regarding the sperm production . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( creat@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to reduced por@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
cau@@ tion is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( creat@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid to be used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring rate of INR ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage to re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , men ought to be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment , to seek advice in terms of the sperm cell loss . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma , and 163 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

relevant C@@ TC tox@@ ici@@ ties reported by &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed included su@@ pra@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mia .
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to 3 P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherap@@ i@@ est@@ u@@ des , except ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in alpha trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly untreated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal initial values of liver function tests .

&quot; in clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and re@@ frac@@ tory ble@@ eding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients that were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ ac@@ id@@ dependent met@@ abolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies , P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the follow@@ er @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by AL@@ IM@@ TA plus Cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in case of chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients that were treated only with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the examination medi@@ ation in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole cis@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were caused by improving the lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of the lung function over time in the control lar@@ m .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy occupied a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 399 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology in favour of di@@ ox@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 0.00@@ 5 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
average P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.15 ) ; the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without com@@ promising the quality of the sample .
it is used with over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats fed with food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i compared patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily st@@ ains on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ yrinth , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ st , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fl@@ utes ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients that are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long term col@@ absorption syndrome ( if not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the inclusion of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK throughout the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine and high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ orted , no adjustment of the dosing is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other ingredients • Pre@@ mature treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fet@@ al individual meal or fet@@ al di@@ ets .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before beginning a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional pregnant women , in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the cili@@ ary por@@ in plasma bricks was observed .
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , INR ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after applying a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dence of known side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single dos@@ es of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple dos@@ es of up to 400 mg three times a day were given to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any system@@ ic effects can be attributed to the li@@ pi@@ vot@@ ant properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect plac@@ ates in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine via kov@@ al@@ ente bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stro and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pi@@ ds .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , high @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.9 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at was not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which was ad@@ ministered by minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified to approxim@@ ate 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety reports , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gene toxic@@ ity , canc@@ ero@@ genic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified as a special threat to humans . &quot;
&quot; according to the version of July 2007 , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in the version of July 2007 , as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ du@@ ed diet . &quot;
&quot; di@@ ets are effective as you can compre@@ hend what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely fall more easily to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Are you fat @-@ induced to decrease the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to physical activity . • Stay up while taking and also after the intake of all@@ i physically active .
&quot; • all@@ i must not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you cannot detect any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you need to stop taking all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about to change the diet at short notice and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;
&quot; flat@@ ul@@ sions with and without low outlet , sudden or increased stu@@ bble ( sof@@ ter and soft chair ) are due to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and thereby emerge that the excess fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment beginning , as at this time you may not have reduced the fat percentage in the diet . &quot;

over@@ weight affects your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cert@@ ain canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis • speak with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily whol@@ esome . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of food packaging . • Recommen@@ ded cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
notice the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is appropriate for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Because of the mode of action of the capsule , the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the probability of nutritional supplements . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg a week without developing fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and also keep it . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional diary containing information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and gre@@ asy products and give guidelines to becoming physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong and moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 by 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for Alo@@ xi &apos;s inclusion in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer diagnosis and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease .
Alo@@ xi &apos;s efficacy for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on ass@@ ay , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , cau@@ tion is advisable in simultaneous use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy regim@@ en , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics directed against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intrav@@ en@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 indu@@ c@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose drug interactions to be observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 mc@@ g. of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 mc@@ g. of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 mc@@ g. of d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g. of d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g. of d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intrav@@ en@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. regim@@ ented pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single dos@@ es of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption According to intrav@@ en@@ ous administration a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours is followed .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intrav@@ en@@ ous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations empha@@ size that once daily intrav@@ en@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) comparable to a one @-@ time intrav@@ en@@ ous dosage of 0.75 mg of measured value ; however the C@@ max after single @-@ use was 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for metabol@@ isation , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less degree , are involved in the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
elim@@ ination After a intrav@@ en@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine ; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; after a unique intrav@@ en@@ ous injection of eyes , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination period and the average system@@ ic exposition with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical studies pointed out that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block I@@ on channels only in very high concentrations , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and pro@@ long the action potential . &quot;
&quot; high dos@@ es of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose corresponds to about the 30@@ t@@ x of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pan@@ cre@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not for mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved in the course of this decision .

June 2006 The Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C for 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is to resem@@ ble a biological medication called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference pharmaceuticals &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ ema should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage occurs , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stim@@ ulates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrates the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ ema with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A. ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of h@@ epatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ ema was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment were treated to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood were reported ) .

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted cannot be sufficient . &quot;
the number of h@@ epatitis C patients responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ema and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ema , the disease experienced more patients than with the reference drug . Al@@ ph@@ ema also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study exam@@ ines the question of how the medicine uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one skin infection , associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ er@@ ations ( cr@@ acks or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ure resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not act against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged 9 months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ duc@@ ted after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 52.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go wei@@ gh in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections over the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections , in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or susp@@ ected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
clinical trials in infected open wounds was insufficient to treat ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on s@@ nu@@ g skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous or@@ aler administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin int@@ be on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement regarding effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deci@@ ding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , it is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials on 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go has applied , the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the administration of the administration , which affects approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance extracted by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( previously Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear harm@@ less , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional antivirus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
absorption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin int@@ be was performed daily with oc@@ cl@@ usion on intact and pe@@ eled skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; in 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin int@@ be twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds , individual plasma tubes were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adults before the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , with small participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ review of gene mut@@ ation and / or chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) sof@@ ter skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and ret@@ ar@@ ded os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is made of mis@@ ery on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ette , unless your doctor advised you to cover the surface . &quot;

&quot; ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two dos@@ es , whereby a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is ad@@ ministered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during the immun@@ ization , ensuring that the vacc@@ ination can be carried out of two dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another h@@ epatitis A or B vacc@@ ine . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and the vacc@@ ine approved in 1997 since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are ad@@ ministered as part of a vacc@@ ine that is comprised of three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rin Adult identical ingredients contain , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence to the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix set a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B. &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine dos@@ es ) are head@@ ache , appe@@ tite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix must not be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals .
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for basic vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is ad@@ ministered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are in the same magn@@ itude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a Hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , require a vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected with no more det@@ ectable antibodies by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the use of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme with the combination vacc@@ ine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of formal h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in the case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as soon as possible , as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular provision to ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was ad@@ ministered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ umps killing vacc@@ ine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ eness , g@@ astro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were ad@@ ministered to a total of 10@@ 27 male impot@@ ence at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matches on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination target , however , not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after a dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
&quot; after the complete in@@ oc@@ ulation , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matches was comparable to per pro@@ book ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were given , compared with 36.@@ 2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of pronounced pain and rough@@ ness was low and comparable to the observed after the combination vacc@@ ine was observed with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 years , the inci@@ dence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that , which was observed in conjunction with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ book , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of impact @-@ effects caused by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials performed in male impot@@ ence between 1 and 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 99.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ sr@@ ate for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 prescribed dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two dos@@ es of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after giving the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; in the following table , the Immun@@ e answers found in a clinical trial study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) has been reached . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of formal h@@ epatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; for persons who were at the time of vacc@@ ination between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs can be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that obtained after vacc@@ ination of 3 dos@@ es with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies are comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was ad@@ ministered simultaneously with the refres@@ her vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 dos@@ es of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ sr@@ ates as for the former formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is examined both before and after the resi@@ du@@ es of sight on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; h@@ epatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from infection with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 dos@@ es . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , respiratory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / hat . &quot;
• If you want to have a quick protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis A / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ine protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ ine series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is being inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . if you / your child are weak@@ ened in your body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child under@@ go a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 S@@ age your doctor if you / your child will receive further medicines ( including those you may have been vacc@@ inated without de@@ preci@@ ation ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has or has been given or is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate points and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be ad@@ ministered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not ad@@ ministered unless it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B. &quot;
important information about specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known for placing first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP presented the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix has been brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;

&quot; also cause appe@@ tite loss , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ aint , fluid retention , head@@ ache , f@@ aint , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ comfortable body odor , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved , because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , with which a complete enzyme defici@@ ency has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for use when the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is contains a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ BER @-@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein toler@@ ances and the daily protein intake of the patient required for growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ ah@@ ole@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ nit@@ ine tran@@ scar@@ cane , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase defici@@ ency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ PS tablets may not be ad@@ ministered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ ia if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet from MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma , patients should only be applied with cau@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate via the liver and kid@@ neys is done , AM@@ PS should only be applied with extreme cau@@ tion in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dos@@ es ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ PS from MONA@@ PS is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
at 56 % of patients in clinical trials at least 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable happ@@ enings it was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ating dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with intrav@@ en@@ ous dosage of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen separation ( sodium b@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and eventually sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ nit@@ ine tran@@ scar@@ s.@@ yl@@ ase defici@@ ency ) , which were treated with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , followed permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral dos@@ es of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after intake of meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ am centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ fatigue syndrome or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , according to different dos@@ es of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma can be found in the following morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single dos@@ es ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma tiles were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosage of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which cannot swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch , or a nas@@ ens@@ on@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept inside the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ ah@@ ole@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ nit@@ ine tran@@ scar@@ cane , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats are exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions came into the pyramid cells of the cran@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ating dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ureth@@ ra ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; based on studies on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ CR@@ C can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , allowing them to accum@@ ulate nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ BRO@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking a medicine with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you should not take AM@@ PS from MONA@@ CO@@ PS , as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , decre@@ ases of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation , memory disturb@@ ances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency reception of your hospital for initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you forgot the taking from MONA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you can no longer use AM@@ BER @-@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date on the cardboard and the container .
&quot; as from MONA@@ PS and content of the package AM@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are provided with the &quot; &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; &quot; em@@ bos@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ BRO@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking a medicine with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; they should take from MONA@@ PS to the same single dos@@ es or@@ ally or over a stomach @-@ fi@@ stel ( hose , which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ ens@@ on@@ de ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; • Step@@ ping out of the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules . • Stri@@ pe a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spo@@ on to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Rem@@ ov@@ ing the recommended amount of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac arr@@ ho@@ ea ) without &quot; ST@@ - Li@@ fting &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the efficacy of one PCI .
&quot; close to 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent the closure ) , and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ go a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as h@@ ep@@ arin in terms of all indicators except for severe ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or any other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin during the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( Inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Lift @-@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intrav@@ en@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is subsequently performed by a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a cle@@ at of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intrav@@ en@@ ous joint dose of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI is planned .
&quot; if this value is short@@ ened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the bol@@ us dose is rapidly ad@@ ministered intrav@@ en@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT equ@@ ates more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is ad@@ ministered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to one PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be ad@@ ministered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage that was included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI clinical trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us using an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intrav@@ en@@ ous formulation of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular h@@ ep@@ arin .
• severe lung damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients . • severe lung damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is ad@@ ministered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n most ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur , patients who under@@ go perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle of ble@@ eding . &quot;
patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ rop@@ athy should be considered to be monitored by the INR @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ rop@@ athy is again att@@ ained before treatment .
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ ors ) , this drug may increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters are regularly checked . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies are in@@ adequate regarding effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , chil@@ d@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated H@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n Group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with H@@ ep@@ arin , women and patients have more than 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to the Acu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ edings as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe ble@@ edings were significantly lower than in groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; a Acu@@ ity severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ i@@ elle , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding or ble@@ eding in the point area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 3 g / dl with known ble@@ eding center , re@@ operation due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; more , less frequently observed ble@@ eding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ori@@ asis in 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n Group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with H@@ ep@@ arin , women and patients have more than 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under H@@ ep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ ically arranged in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ rop@@ athy is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the Cat@@ aly@@ tic Centre and the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ ungs@@ Region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or an inn@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part spreads the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus regener@@ ates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; moreover , through bi@@ val@@ ori@@ ze with ser@@ um of patients , in which it has come to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction induced . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n shows a dose of dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effects that are covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , INR and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following eyes , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the Acu@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated h@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was ad@@ ministered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ sis inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
&quot; in the Acu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ go within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or as a permanent inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate the glu@@ cose level ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or that the ins@@ ulin can not be processed effectively .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is very slightly different from human ins@@ ulin and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter time period than a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the application in combination with a slow ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness has been the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was established compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin lis@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in normal normal ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the dos@@ es of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cose level .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or the del@@ ta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin metabolism , ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin delivery ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can change the ins@@ ulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or break@@ through of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the ins@@ ulin used and can therefore change in the change of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glu@@ cose activity and increase incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ ates , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or ab@@ sent under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta @-@ loos@@ ening , cl@@ oni@@ dine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserves . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ inated after oral use . &quot;
&quot; below are listed in clinical studies of undes@@ irable drug restrictions , group@@ ed by system organ@@ ites and sorted by decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy is negl@@ ected to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , can result in a Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cose ( 0,5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly @-@ trained person , or by intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of glu@@ cose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lowers blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripher@@ al glu@@ cose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active time is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a di@@ spro@@ por@@ tional glu@@ cose @-@ ending effect in a therapeutic dosage range of 0,@@ 075 to 0.15 E / kg , and with 0,3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ por@@ tional increase of glu@@ cose @-@ healing effect , just like Human@@ ity ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glu@@ cose @-@ healing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
&quot; the data was clear that in an application of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a compar@@ ative post@@ pran@@ ational gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , like with normal regular ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in had been warned 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ pran@@ ational control was achieved than with normal normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with normal normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ten before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before the start of the meal in comparison to normal normal ins@@ ulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as compared to human regular ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
