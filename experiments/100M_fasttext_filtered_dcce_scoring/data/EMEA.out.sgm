<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied or the smelting tablets applied in patients to which the swallowing of tablets troubles."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works primarily as a "partial agonist" for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less extent acts as neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"because dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazl contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms to be lessened and their recurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with that of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the alteration of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body resorbates the enamel tablets and the solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased ease than patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">"furthermore, Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-casses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled infusion), acathisie (nausea), somnolence (nausea), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue and fatigue, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Causes (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were referred to the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission granted the inclusion of Abilify in the entire European Union to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes were referred to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the incidence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorder, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher suicidal risk of Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions, which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolity, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesis appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with an Abilify treat symptoms and symptoms of late dysphagia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms associated with a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with convulsions in the anamnesis or for conditions associated with convulsions."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an elevated risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a trial with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphics and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, with which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"because of the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines associated with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist family, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should predominate potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- Concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation in humans and due to the concerns incurred in the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below depends on the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients with oplanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment. "</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the launch of the market, accidental or intentional overdosage with Aripiprazole was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosage with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is beneficial, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma image binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated over the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"when using Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the Putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 zophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder respondents who had a response to study medication were similar (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"actual values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asmine Depressionsrate scale showed significantly greater improvement than at Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial, over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the recurrence rate at 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and at 57% in placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar I incident, Aripiprazol showed a superior effect compared to placebo for reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and actively-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a positive effect compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients treated with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period before Randomisation showed themselves to placebo superior to the prevention of a bipolar residue, mainly in prevention of a recurrence in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and Hydroxyprofiling of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination of Elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and close 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"at Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis cirrhosis (Child-Pugo class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the erogeneous potential, preclinical data could not detect any special dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinds-toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of middle steady state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the Hydroxy- Metabolites of Aripiprazol in the Galle from monkeys to repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle by monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonylamine or insulin, the existing dose of sulfonylamine or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonylamine or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, thereby improving type 2 diabetes."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in case of more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos was investigated in tripletherapy; in this case patients received a combination of metformin with sulphylamine, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos has led to lowering the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood glucose levels are reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylamine in lowering the HbA1c values decreased by 0.94% while the addition of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study, in which the combination of Actos and Insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, infections of upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin for patients in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">"October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to permit Actos to operate in the entire European Union."</seg>

<seg id="765">"for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually."</seg>

<seg id="864">"in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, showing how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="866">"Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels have been lowered considerably as with another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the complete list in the package insert)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002 the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S to approve acetane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">"premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day, if a fast initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect."</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood glucose attitude has improved significantly, for example by an intensive insulin therapy, can detect hypoglycemia symptomatic changes and should be consulted accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, bipolar, long acting insulin, insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA against insulin of animal origin) may result in a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the changeover."</seg>
<seg id="876">"some patients, in which hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"traveling with several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken in other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia caused by a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>

<seg id="884">"general conditions and complaints at the administration of the resort - Local oversensitivity reactions to the injection site While the insulin therapy may occur local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site)."</seg>

<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Easy hydrate glucose can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sugar-containing foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape varieties, sweets, biscuits, or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0,5 to 1,0 mg) by a proven help person or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the total time period is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, gene toxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards to humans."</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane hot water bottle is taken out of the fridge - temperature of insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) decreases before it is absorbed in accordance with the instructions for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be carried out on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"following the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "body foreign" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"by doing so, the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in a contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane lining of the virus with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign body), was disconnected, and used as an integral part of the vaccine."</seg>

<seg id="1911">"vastasis was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low dosed Ritonavir increased drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who previously used protease inhibitors with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-traceable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or alteration of virus last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the studies with patients who previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"in children, Agenerase also decreased the viral load, however, with the children who were previously treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1916">"in the study with adults, previously treated with protease inhibitors, the drug increased with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:"</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of asgenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of vastasis in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors is not proven."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"vastasis was originally licensed under" "extraordinary circumstances", "as at the time of permission for scientific reasons only limited information was available."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approved a permit for transferring vastases to the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"asgenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children over 4 years."</seg>

<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than one capsule; hence asgenerase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses must be applied to asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily)."</seg>

<seg id="1933">"pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of vastasis in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily."</seg>

<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing currants (hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present anti-retroviral therapy including treatment with genera does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus resulted in a rise in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose."</seg>

<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of ketoconazole with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax from ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can, if they are used together with genera, may cause interactions."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"in a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma torate increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol declined by about 86% (90% -consecutive interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"consequently, the simultaneous donation of vastasis with kritonavir is not recommended together with these glucocosteroids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment predominate the risk of systemic corticosteroeroid effects (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive increases in plasma bricks are expected during simultaneous administration of vastasis."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of therapeutical concentrations up to stabilization of mirrors, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the same time (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore asgenerase must not be applied together with orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3) while caution is advisable while using asgenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>

<seg id="2614">"in chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185)."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"in comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 by 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients)."</seg>
<seg id="2616">"in March 2005, the European Commission granted to the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for Aloxi's inclusion in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer diagnosis and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Aloxi's efficacy for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"since Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection."</seg>
<seg id="2620">"as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable in simultaneous use of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the QT interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension."</seg>
<seg id="2621">"in addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"in preclinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutics directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C)."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"in a clinical trial, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"in a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Chlorpromazine, Chlorpromazin, Chlorpromazin, Paroxetine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"experiences for the use of palonosetron in human gestures are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used during pregnancy, unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micrograms (total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%)."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of appointments (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"in the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose drug interactions to be observed."</seg>
<seg id="2629">"no dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective in an aloxi- overdose."</seg>
<seg id="2630">"in two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, and 250 mcg. of cyclophosphamide, and 250 mcg. of cyclophosphamide, and 250 mcg. of doxorubicin and 250 mcg. of cyclophosphamide and 250 mcg. of doxorubicin and 250 mcg. of cyclophosphamide and 250 mcg. of doxorubicin and 250 mcg."</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"following the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of I.V. regimented palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous administration a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours is followed.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations emphasize that once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) comparable to a one-time intravenous dosage of 0.75 mg of measured value; however the Cmax after single-use was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effects on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies for metabolisation, CYP2D6 and, in less degree, are involved in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine; Palonosetron as unaltered substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a unique intravenous injection of eyes, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination period and the average systemic exposition with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 out of preclinical studies pointed out that Palonosetron can block Ion channels only in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponds to about the 30tx of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary gland, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not for mice."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"the underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is low for humans."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Alphema and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up the treatment with Alphema, the disease experienced more patients than with the reference drug. Alphema also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study examines the question of how the medicine uses an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (one skin infection, associated with crust formation) and small infected laerations (cracks or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicure resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not act against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients aged 9 months, but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was deducted after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response: if the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo weigh in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections over the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small laerations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the launch of Altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitization or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wipes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections, in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials in infected open wounds was insufficient to treat retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2- or 3-day treatment occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentration, which were achieved in humans after topical application on snug skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>

<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate regarding a statement regarding effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"when deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo has applied, the most frequently reported side effect irritation was at the administration of the administration, which affects approximately 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance extracted by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (previously Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partially block P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms appear harmless, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the vitro activity of retapamulin opposite S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional antivirus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a healthy adult study 1% Retapamulin intbe was performed daily with occlusion on intact and peeled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">"in 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin intbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma tubes were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugars) in the blood or that the insulin can not be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insinglulisine is very slightly different from human insulin and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter time period than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in the application in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness has been the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was established compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisals."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in normal normal ulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insinglulisine or any other ingredients, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>

<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or breakthrough of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the activity profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the change of the treatment scheme.</seg>
