&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of standard Settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile it . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Tools . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes if existing . &quot;
the module Connection Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras pane filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default the display begins with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbar and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing a ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property , that the sum of the sizes of the sub @-@ ordered objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder represents the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ Plus representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles own useful color imaging and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on by view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles can be used ( which , as a result , specify the relative position of the in@@ scription on the rect@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of presentation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the tre@@ mor in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always kept . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses due to the frame , that rect@@ angles are created , which are as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View stop by area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras picture gallery ... or using Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line has a slider and a turning area to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

display the box file size of the image and determine if the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
show whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored . &quot;
&quot; using the Sub@@ folders button , you can set a slider or a pad@@ dle up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original pictures to the gallery .
&quot; using the comment file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tioning the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box Sel@@ ene color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Show menu under window navigation pane or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that deny access to this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SIE for pages , which reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SIE browser recognition to call up &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not con@@ form to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of these split browsers .
&quot; with this option , the inserted browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting . &quot;
set up menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ .com. &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a fast image editing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides do@@ zens of professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a page in error reporting system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; then we &apos;d like to give you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and hopefully soon , we &apos;d like to answer questions from other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tie ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ;
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for regi@@ stering in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . this path will be stored for all the image folders .
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ k@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a compilation of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; viewed each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be modified . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requested recur@@ sively the library path throughout its entire depth . you cannot exclu@@ de sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos than symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ p ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Adju@@ st@@ ors and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ .com. &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk device . the camera will also be used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may connect to the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed protocol for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ is@@ sions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now de@@ prec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images can be read from digi@@ ti@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much sim@@ pler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; themselves perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or change in full screen mode using F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , data list , or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the toolbar . thus , the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed on the toolbar , and which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single night@@ mare . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ ds or after the date the album was first created . the date can be changed in the album &apos;s properties . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . just select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album and edit the album properties context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so you can be group@@ ed by a common name . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
&quot; buttons el@@ der , average , new ester : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the passage of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , the first picture is chosen in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Set As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be sc@@ anned .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports input of keywords for single photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect .
&quot; the image window will display the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the preview images are generated . this can be avoided , in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , can be changed using the digi@@ ti@@ zed settings . select the Albums tab here and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help window that appears . when you leave the mouse po@@ inter at a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose from the viewing menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images .
you can open image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the digi@@ ti@@ zed image processing you can view and edit your photos .
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by checking the context menu with right mouse button and selecting the program from the Open Menu program . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing , other image processing programs can come to problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . therefore , this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nails to preview and turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can right click the preview button and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , it is moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer von &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ st@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; Tags are stick@@ ers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; Tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this , you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; collapse so that you can easily find the keywords you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ title of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the keyword in the keyword menu . you can change the keyword and symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select the album as album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; s functionality to handle keywords , you first need to put your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you choose the photos you want with a keyword you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and choose from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to be assigned to it . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the menu menu Rem@@ ove the menu . the menu only displays the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open it , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here but as a live search that always fil@@ tered what you &apos;ve entered as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it , it appears filter in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search is done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if you select a search process , the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select Advanced Search , the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search Tools section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the Cont@@ ext Menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search options , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for search query in the album database . all rules are lined with search group / search group , added or deleted from it . each option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added to this list with search group / Search group . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GH@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; each image character@@ izes by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to be compared by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; other entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; finds the matching pictures . also here can be set a sw@@ elling value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program .
in the field below you can specify a name for your geo @-@ filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em be@@ acon from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use Paar@@ weise navig@@ ating from the toolbar , then the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the fields . this simpli@@ fies the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal er@@ aser also works directly from the be@@ acon like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview pictures in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can detect in the crossed arrows . to bend the visible area of the picture , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will be shown in the same image area . &quot;
zoom slider under the images or Ctr@@ l ; Mouse Wheel to zoom in and forth . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers each part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , remove , group , backup , assess , refine , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , searches , transform@@ ations , pre@@ assembled and exports content that have@@ a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you manage something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time . &quot;
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you &apos;re making enough photos then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend to save the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed metadata in the Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget it , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? for this , &amp; digi@@ came ; you have provided a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense since you can focus on the best photos when working on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now take a keyword , keywords , as you often call upon other programs or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically mount the tree for you and paste the images to the right place . sorting of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section is referring to labels or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alog@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure about how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; W@@ ow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you might even hear the silence . the in@@ scription therefore has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit to Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an in@@ scription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t Earth a boring planet in front of G@@ oog@@ le@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and will be deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trip through images with geo @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information about the setup side of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example , to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s identity . &quot;
&quot; author Title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples of this can be title like : Ange@@ stell@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be as well filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations may be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the image is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill in the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify them in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : PLA@@ T@@ TEN@@ FE@@ HL@@ ER , disk failure , power consumption , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , dis@@ aster@@ work , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a brand . these types of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices aren &apos;t much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sum@@ s . in spite of this massive protection they are used by chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies reserve your stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the bug mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ co &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated at temperatures range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , SMAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses normally can be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of power , this can cause serious damage when devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause severe key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed Mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and ground@@ ed the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not each connector also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be sure that all peripher@@ als that are connected to your system should also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and TV boards . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over @-@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for lap@@ tops , and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be reasonable to invest in a breakdown @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically place cordless energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run the system . some models allow them to even continue to work until the current runs . additionally , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and and compare its security in case of electricity problems with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are at home compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss , since they generate inter@@ efer@@ ences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk fail@@ ures at low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . please read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ stations . not@@ ebooks already amounts to 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a minor damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture adjustments from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteri@@ or@@ ating . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . therefore , make sure your data is affected by a data loss . so , backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash suggests you may be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ guns : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , dis@@ aster@@ isk is always a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss in spite of backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
backup important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , retained associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , storage , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus , valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to consider all that is going to happen today with cau@@ tion and re @-@ evaluate it during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to behave as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier every year . &quot;
GIF is a proprietary format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore .
&quot; PNG has been created as an open source standard which should replace GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in an un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , since 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored which stands for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP can also be used as it can save the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider if you use the metadata separately from the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that integr@@ ates fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of uses and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; if you import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as a temporary f@@ use . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then you should re @-@ add the metadata ; these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to Web@@ gal@@ erien , bo@@ de in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , connect them with the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn on . for more information , please refer to the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side strips features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
&quot; the metadata feature displays the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download selected . &quot;
&quot; when your camera supports this , an option to download New is available . these pictures have been downloaded with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the buttons View All or use Sel@@ ected Download , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; upload the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting all delete all . if you want to delete only some , you need to select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase them from the camera , you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you upload photos of different recording galleries to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission will open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ den@@ tit@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % S , for example , switch the date &amp; time option . for further custom@@ ization you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to modify the file names in lower case letters . or in capital letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name to preview the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during the down@@ loader . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ came ; this is used to automatically download subtitles in the target album . all images with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in that case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , and digi@@ came ; you , where the pictures are to be loaded , click the desired folder and click OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in length and width graphics and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to store the location data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data get into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ages and card references . the question is at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic assignment ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmitt@@ ing the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ px format since this is the only format supported by the module to the geo@@ graphic assignment . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ act Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the em@@ bos@@ sed coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; change . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings digi@@ ti@@ zed menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
select action to preview or start editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; fixed if you click on one entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ ation and copyright information . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera unit . even with database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Title is a syn@@ onym for author @-@ line : this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer . this may be names such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is an image agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; offering . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus , it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without lost . &quot;
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded print@@ ings ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with images embedded in images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse po@@ inter appears in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; each file in one &amp; digi@@ came ; any file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colours are specified here . in the image processing this approach mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF files compressed , you can disable the defl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect image quality since the defl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files can be saved without loss . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata is not yet supported but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very quick to develop a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which is photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , as a result of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed light as penet@@ rating white . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and d@@ c@@ raw try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construc@@ ting , you get the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ ro@@ h@@ data generated by the color fil@@ tered image sensor , which has many cameras and which has a matrix of color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ c@@ raw provides you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ c@@ raw . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction since you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; information such as color information from a colour space in the others to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible .
if a picture is opened in the image processing / ink management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder Send here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; examine this folder during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed later when opening the raw file . &quot;
&quot; the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any color @-@ mapping or gam@@ ma correction . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be corrected manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile with them is intended for . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ .com. These modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu , in the Settings menu . &quot;
further information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other cross boxes turn on the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during display . &quot;
&quot; camera features show a list of cameras supported currently on the left . on the right hand side there is a button Auto detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are now supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer to place it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera model and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can view the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly passed by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you need to apply changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; under certain circumstances this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this leng@@ th@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ came ; you know if it should delete them from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can choose from the toolbar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry View / Edit .
some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; some of them are not part of your distribution . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; editing features of image processing modify your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should then make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save As .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restor@@ ing the image editing from the File menu or using the Rec@@ over Rec@@ over Rec@@ over Rec@@ over in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last time . &quot;
almost every action of editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore by selecting Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should check the keyboard short@@ cuts , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and Ctr@@ l ; Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the back or restore button in the toolbar at a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; when you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture r@@ unter or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and zoom out in which you can use Ctr@@ l ; Mouse Wheel or the Symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Report menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the image in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can view this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ came ; you can view this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ came ; you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed main window . see this section to set up image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select Print image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or entire sets . entire image files can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ ports print assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders clicks : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear again into the border .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored . &quot;
&quot; besides the user kno@@ b , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating from the side@@ bar is applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to a single image . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the keyword is a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the relevant tick boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword of the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side strip is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is shown . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a cal@@ ender tag . the keyword filter refers to No keywords , which has been reduced to three images , and a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Other .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it would be one or more , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Extended search for all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one sets up a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that origin@@ ate from your camera or scanner come with a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actual photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner , and the colors that you print or publish on the web that match your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to push for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means you have to make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below you do not need to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus need to worry about color administration ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I chose to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor because s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on s@@ RGB cal@@ li@@ zed , you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you try a further manual processing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic contrast and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity value over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without changing color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; same : this method adju@@ sts the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the same number of pixels makes it possible to improve the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that works miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it det@@ ects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast Incre@@ ase : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB value of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ oping of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balancing algorithm protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it through the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the upper right a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also di@@ gest . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in the white balance . this is shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Store do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button pres@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the neutral white balance . note that , even neutral settings will give a different photo than your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping may be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Key Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to always use the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual on tone correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for grad@@ ation that you can find in color grad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar installation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the image . the coloured , dark areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to finely adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar energy . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes a lot of photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contr@@ asts .
the Ne@@ on Filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo at low light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to consider satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool grad@@ ation and the simple cand@@ l@@ esti@@ ck / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is based on sound correction for improving the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purposes explained here . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders into which are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right you can see the original and preview of the picture . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , and the following options are available on the left . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic separation is useful .
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pin@@ outs can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values enable the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to manipul@@ ate the output values , for example , to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded later . the Gim@@ p Levels Format will be used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all the color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the light tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark output oils and which become the associated pixel dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve showing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and loading : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kanal . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line is displayed in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding colour value .
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will be able to change the general brightness even if you have the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , because the channel mixer then is the tool for generating great black / white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour@@ ing . &quot;
save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any arbit@@ r@@ ary mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all the color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar light scenes at day@@ time .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the sh@@ ading sounds . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ tic oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of magni@@ fied points or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool box add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the image rounds out with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce cuts it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you cut the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any place . this also works on several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . after saving the image , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool template you can lay a st@@ encil on a picture .
the Picture Template menu apply in image editing can be used to create templates via a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add image database with maximum compression ( 9 ) , just send an email in English to die &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your st@@ encil folder with the Base Fol@@ der button . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be marked for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root folder for the templates has been set , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces particularly in dark areas . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to let a picture look shar@@ per . actually , it shar@@ p@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric smoke and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process must be summar@@ ized with only minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
JPEG images often have a camera internal shar@@ p@@ ness . images in raw format on the other hand must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some sc@@ anners use an edge finder already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you will get the control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ation shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , you should avoid cau@@ tion because the results do not work very naturally : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases shar@@ p@@ ness of edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen a picture re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve more information and a comparison of all the techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for using the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in radius or amount will increase the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are generated near sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should shar@@ pen shots best in their final resolution . &quot;
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture which is added to the original . this will set the shar@@ p@@ ness of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimal difference in this way for a channel of the filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are exemp@@ ted from shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore avoided sel@@ fl@@ aws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ right@@ ed un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the g@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result from the source pixel which is far from the original pixel , which results in most cases very strongly from the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be selected by 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.99 . high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pest effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; ash &apos;@@ sche shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß ash shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter if your shar@@ p@@ ness Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch . this is most often caused by a previously executed un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size may generate good results , especially if you select great values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the g@@ auss , but in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave un@@ comfortable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; in theory , invisible mas@@ c@@ ers must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Wiener Filter , it &apos;s always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto Focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods used to focus on digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pu@@ pi@@ l .
&quot; the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pu@@ pi@@ l . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust filter settings fine , you can use the smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image . &quot;
&quot; direction addi@@ ction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value to the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ eff@@ ekt it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is running through . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle grad@@ ation da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles make a long run time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the increase of quality that you get by selecting this option is only small . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Store do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a poor film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ let noise . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor sounds from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about the sensor sounds of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings can remain with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter .
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ ma toler@@ ances of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which are typically more roug@@ hed up . however , it also does not poll@@ ute the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; cushi@@ oning : controls the alignment of the phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for using the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors occurring in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture mapping is done with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce compression : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in an un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save As and Store do exactly this . any setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved into a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Cancel . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with simult@@ an@@ ous smo@@ kers will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity from 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film grain on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original picture below ( 1 ) can be seen and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixels of photos with a CCD camera close , eight have to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &apos; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the corrected image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
dur@@ ess : an average of the adjacent pixel is calculated . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square finish ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block . &quot;
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot light the entire sensor area ev@@ enly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead of sh@@ ading the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ ep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image used without this filter . the tool for vi@@ gn@@ etting is used by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light gain at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or acci@@ dentally a light intensity of 2 , or acci@@ dentally elev@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decre@@ ases the brightness of pixels . you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the grad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing from the menu color grad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contrast correction is also carried out in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth gear cor@@ re@@ cts the distant corners opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion second degrees . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ ish distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the fourth gear . this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite symbol of the parameter general . &quot;
zoom : this value changes the image size and thus results in the correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decre@@ ases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the t@@ onn@@ - or cushion correction should be performed before tri@@ mming or size changes . it is best to perform this correction as the first one . if you re@@ cut a picture and then perform a th@@ under correction the effect would be apparent the fal@@ con .
&quot; to help you find the best correction tool this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . in connection , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ - / cushion distor@@ tion by using the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the image editing tool in the Edit menu or via the Zoom slider to remove this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects , such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of a barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org website that is re@@ achable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for pre@@ viewing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set film gran@@ ularity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO controller modi@@ fies the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter system applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO assets generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Fil@@ tr@@ ation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix major silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo , gra@@ iny sight specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie bas@@ tion effect on a black / white image applied . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large pictures . smooth brush controls the smooth@@ ness or from the other side .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sketch . the lines , which could change the outline in the drawing , are empha@@ sized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to re@@ produce your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wav@@ eb@@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the Wave Blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Cancel .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by rotating the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : ob@@ sc@@ ures the picture by horizontal motion of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or turn Fot@@ ograf@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
cont@@ actor un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ob@@ sc@@ ures the image by random displac@@ ement of pixels and thus sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Cancel .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter drop drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . &quot;
photo bu@@ b@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in or guess the details ? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the size you want with the tool size . choose the transformation size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to di@@ aper the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for bu@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bu@@ b@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ en@@ eff@@ ekt it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the Save As and loading are used exactly for this purpose . each inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo bu@@ b@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Cancel . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bu@@ b@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small colour image on double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo , you simply need to use the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply using the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the blank , use the button The Cli@@ ppers button of the image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save file Save as in the File menu to save the newly edited photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . &quot;
&quot; using the aspect ratio , the tool uses relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , In@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to c@@ entering the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are saved as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the assem@@ bling help allow you to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden centre : the golden center is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the blades of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all possible things we perceive as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resul@@ t@@ ant divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s ga@@ ze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line of being without the eye , it will fulfill its purpose . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the golden spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the center@@ points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that unlike harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a uniform tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be seen a static object dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise . &quot;
the options horizontal flip and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button Color , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . now , move it with a pressure to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the function Automatic Rand@@ om . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation , but note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current Ang@@ le in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current Ang@@ le in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : shows the current Ang@@ le in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
corner right below : shows the current Ang@@ le in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments make a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to sli@@ ce the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is not rotating , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors down horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; moving the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve done the she@@ ar , the image gets caught a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect usually is neg@@ li@@ gible , but two bul@@ ls are generating twice as much p@@ amper@@ ing and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after she@@ ar the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; shows only files in formats to which you know . this happens with the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the image editing pane . if the extension is listed in the image editing pane . if the extension is listed in the image editing pane . if the extension is listed in the image processing , you can change this list of file extensions that the &amp; digi@@ came ; see the configuration section for more information . &quot;
&quot; almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats . &quot;
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can view raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports loading raw pictures only with the d@@ c@@ raw program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a movie file , it has no movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to preview movies or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ came ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to start playing . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ ing , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , etc . . use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ tur Custom quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the bottom for comparison the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adapted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot Custom color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the Pal@@ let View . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to select such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse to the left left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box is enabled under the Add color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides a different one ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write . this mode can be set by selecting the tick box over@@ write under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line marker , if another color is followed . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;

&quot; after you have selected one or more dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position in the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zoom in both directions is limited by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph@@ ene graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can re @-@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Once Up@@ loading page gives you the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program can be consul@@ ted each time . &quot;
opening gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
&quot; the session administration page gives you the ability to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session , or not ) , or determine to be asked for each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries on how they are described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of orient@@ ated graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; fd@@ p ; -@@ algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger to treat large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm coordinates the no@@ des circular in according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph@@ file as parameters , and specify the calculated layout of the graph by st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; the graph@@ vi@@ z ; the graph@@ eme with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ executed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be shown if necessary . otherwise , it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse po@@ inter . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse po@@ inter to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it needs the following packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; you will find more options in the Settings menu .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot;
&quot; once you do not und@@ o a step , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; create a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and toolbar . &quot;

&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pi@@ x or display lin@@ e@@ ale and set one color : or a chess board as a banner ad . you can also choose for the chess board the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and big as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module pic@@ ks up tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
you can also select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the default duc@@ ti@@ he your own to select your image . see the preview and adjust the range of your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window will be completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have cli@@ cked the button , wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file . remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image . &quot;
screen shots you can create after you have selected in the Edit menu &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all separate program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible job . if you have picked up the complete work@@ space , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay controls how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to get the time to get there . &quot;
&quot; once the screenshot has been made , the Options dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management in the internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r is possible to provide photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos online and show your photos safely and private to your friends and family all over the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be run by the process of generating a to@@ ken . this is used for your authentication . so , a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . you will be presented the following page after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; when export@@ ing to Fli@@ ck@@ r to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . you are currently not using any other per@@ missions . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by com@@ ma . they are added to the image as keywords during high loading .

&quot; if you select change the size of the photos before loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . cau@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic loc@@ alisation provides tools to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above looking dialog appears then . in order to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; if the file loads , an automatic cor@@ relation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS lane data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . the devi@@ ation below the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a locom@@ otive is located between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relation button for inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog tells the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Exec@@ ute this again and again , until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the three buttons on the right side allows you to quickly select a large number of albums .
&quot; the tab defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on an image , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &quot;
the tab album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG File format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . naturally , the file size influences too . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Close to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and use basic operations such as turns , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mou@@ ld@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a wind@@ owed mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool for modi@@ fying images without interfer@@ ing with your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses on quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the colour information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . cau@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata model , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check exc@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets . you can also add an audio file to MP@@ 2 or WAV of slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the images to be packed into the m@@ peg slideshow . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow . &quot;
the images you selected are then listed in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your needs , you can proceed with the button encoding the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slideshow while you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets using the Settings button on the right . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p Module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ c@@ raw from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ c@@ raw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get with d@@ c@@ raw better results ! &quot;
first select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ ZW compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format because it only permits a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion using the output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the option to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images from an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can zoom in or enlarge the image .
&quot; proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; propor@@ tion@@ ate ( 2 dim . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . adding pictures you can add pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list to add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are attached as attachment .
do not pay too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original exc@@ if@@ data are added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button closing , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option in the presentation enable very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic map because otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the filename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in random order . so it will not be used to order the images in the album .
&quot; between the pictures , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects any transition between the images .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the chosen sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , you are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your work area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . they can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save their own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined by yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button that is located on the right outside the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can choose which view can be displayed for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to view the image view window ( described in more detail ) and you can select the image for the corresponding person . &quot;
&quot; when you open the search in the main window , a dialog appears to you , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog lets you view the image once more . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to enter a string order in the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry of the screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time or select the menu entry for the first time . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different sched@@ ules . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame . if you select an area , only images of this tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the User Manual the included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ sample pages see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . for more information about the export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , you can &apos;t use this option to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically discussed . &quot;
&quot; on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 no longer download images , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , you can browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub @-@ folder for each subsequent set .
&quot; first you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings currently described are related to all three basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
the following will describe the dialog for export@@ ing images that you can view from the File menu ...
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; with the option Manu@@ ally to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file with the option ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ er the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a D@@ ane ) while this category is named for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the imported file and which categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Sett@@ ing up the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about images , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder where your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use them in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained to you . &quot;
&quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select an in@@ scription and a symbol .
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group set up once in a group rather than all groups of a mid @-@ gli@@ b as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . for more information see the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules itself .
&quot; because the modules of several applications are used together , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using this on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage of sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order isn &apos;t supported , it sim@@ ulates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it is used to use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category characters , do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , whether you have selected persons to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool bar at the top . currently , you will see the window with which you can browse the image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any image with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used up are shi@@ fted upwards , finding people faster and as@@ signing them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the upper left . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ lay . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can easily drag one entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . please see that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking on the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , clicking and moving . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window range . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which allows you to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely f@@ ade a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the Options ... and here then window a / hide . this procedure can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply by drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , simply by drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , it is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Edit menu either . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , pictures can also be saved somewhere , with that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images from which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from folders and then copy it back . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little bit more privacy , you can filter the images so that at the end you may want to see the pictures that you may see for others , and click on the latest View from the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to hide the laptop now of your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , so all the images you have locked up are hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click lock lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for one there are all the images on the hard drive , and on the one you can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to disable the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to take a look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to see them some@@ time . for this reason , it has a picture and video viewer . this can be started from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have given about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag them with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow , then load a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
a very useful ability of viewers of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can zoom in with the mouse . zoom The Plus button is zo@@ omed in the middle of the image and shows the zoom @-@ rect@@ angle and shows the result of zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity key sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Notes from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . but you may prefer to just select the image and view more pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad while you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with characteristics while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have set features on your images , they are available in the browser . so , you can view all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , you can simply press the characters for the feature once the image has been selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your ch@@ amo@@ is later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted . to switch off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture draw from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not fully domin@@ ate , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire @-@ mode views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will pop up to allow you to choose the correct position : &quot;
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button context menu .
&quot; if you have changed features , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have left invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or Cancel changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the object displayed with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered using the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you wish to render only part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visual level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . Objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool bar .
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window settings or if you need any other arrangement , you can set it arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also save multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views to each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map icon at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window settings are floating screens : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the front row . &quot;
to close a view click on the small cross in the start @-@ up bar . to prevent the closing click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
you can save the current window view with view window settings ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window settings under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 up to date . this version is in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item . &quot;
&quot; a render mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub @-@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or steps in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property see better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling reduces the neighboring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is still further divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels will be processed with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;

&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exce@@ eds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed separately and be checked for further classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit an object . &quot;
opens a new window for the ad &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason here .
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; not the full command sum of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support sourc@@ ec@@ ode in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this inserts the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste sourc@@ ec@@ ode for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is pov@@ ray or x @-@ pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . here you will find the path to your document and the version . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. altitude field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the library , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file comes in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for viewing field in camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
&quot; you can set the object size of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire @-@ model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire models are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projection . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scene . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window configurations , or create new window arrangements . in the Window Proced@@ ure section , you will explain how you can create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the Standard Window Proced@@ ure : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window assign@@ ments shows all existing window configurations . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you will not anchor a map view along with the previous view and floating the view not anch@@ ored in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate yet simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that as a result you will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed all the error free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols to be used frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item delete . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the user button or enter the input paste , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could for example insert a squ@@ ad ( insert final body squ@@ ad ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene ren@@ ders , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the icon + before the object . then you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property panel ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you see no color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then preview the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should already be done , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as the floor create : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press Enter or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball is floating above the floor , as you moved the floor by one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange outcome : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , insert a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first Under@@ stand and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effects and refl@@ ections already result in partial good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities for you &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ pricing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays sho@@ ots from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect the visual effects of pixels . &quot;
&quot; without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; created
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is saved in the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o @-@ und@@ o command . you can only select this menu item if you have used editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er using this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option tool@@ holder for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to f@@ ool rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ r@@ action on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying a image file as a color map . &quot;
&quot; it is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full@@ screen mode .
using &amp; B@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or whether all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching filename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working practices of &amp; ball show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves and k@@ ick@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens and ba@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can configure &amp; h@@ ick@@ show , so you can only display some of the file types that the program can display . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
speci@@ fies whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ball show ; in the cards cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ball show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;

the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
&quot; in the range of exposure index@@ ing indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display a light color and over@@ exposure , a dark colour . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions for the selected images . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures that no longer make pictures to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images that no longer performs as pictures . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; command . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; termin@@ ate .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can first start a pre @-@ scan and then select the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
to select the image better the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview into the window .
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lick ? en leads to a break and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by button Settings , the same name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save pictures . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically select with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is saved each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the kno@@ b Over starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and function . the global short@@ cut keys can be set up by clicking with right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ cuts . &quot;
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands , making your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some custom command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all needed modules are present and use the dialog to see why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ SOR@@ &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this is usually used by ex@@ ec ( ) . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should regularly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events if it does not have any use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , every script itself needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ als a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Title paths Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu entry has been cli@@ cked . in order to add an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ izing Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ Title ) . to add an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ized Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clean@@ up work . for this purpose , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b have downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.g. my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the compilation amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly design@@ ate your script packages . &quot;
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) ; the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can download it at www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the W@@ iki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; script scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the root folder of Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist and / or . if the option is turned off , only the playlist window is displayed . &quot;
&quot; tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental feature of the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; place mood files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the memory location of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the memory location of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist when saving , saves the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of music files . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ Date piece visible when changing the piece , ensures that the play@@ lists pop up / roll down to keep the running piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context @-@ browser automatically shows the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section App@@ ear@@ ance you can customize and Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Scrip@@ tures , the otherwise gray depicted section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set up your own color scheme . use the selected color sel@@ ector for front and background color . &quot;
continue playing at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to set off the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is hoo@@ ked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows effect that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using custom colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if self @-@ made colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set the O@@ SD on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop@@ down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this map .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; to select a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes cross sections to set out how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folder re@@ itali@@ c : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically added will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part of the collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another device is necessary in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql facility section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using computers , the computer is entered , on which the my@@ S@@ ql database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
&quot; the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm sets the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server , and create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you can enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
&quot; get a similar interpre@@ ter : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ts to the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ fm @-@ profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs it contains because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that you can delete the file and leave the file again .
most of the time this is that Tag@@ lib is cr@@ ashes from this file when reading the Meta information . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. , Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X compiled , then this leads to crash when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically on a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but don &apos;t feature as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &apos; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeti@@ tion / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ co@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ co@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check if Amar@@ ok can check the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . for this , use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error , if something is due to the fixing of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start Window was converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Show . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select Von playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there just like you would do with other files too . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the add button , the playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also to lib@@ visual this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder are included ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the sink sink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously to output audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you search for the problem matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to provide a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . the enlargement of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beam react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . perform g@@ st register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run it in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute g@@ st @-@ register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please contact bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a complete list of suggestions or wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa your@@ sel@@ ect@@ Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e row into the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click on &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ? &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , you can use files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ String values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then , select rating . then you can edit the rating of a piece exactly as all other attributes also , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and click Edit : select rating or press F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want to inform you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not to be brought together with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find anno@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and take the required changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click Cre@@ ate New Design .... &quot;
the symbol was too similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; you probably need to install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; AD@@ DER &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from merlin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error is no element present to handle the file &apos;s Mim@@ eti@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the g@@ stre@@ amer fa@@ ad module is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s Mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you can play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator , restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output type the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the Setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio input , and output is done on the USB sound card . so lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supporting m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can naturally take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can get the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then you will be able to help you with your help . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection facilitates you to save the remaining matching entries . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the pop @-@ up playlist . you &apos;ll find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply right click on an entry and follow the Burn menu .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a multi @-@ fac@@ eted multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including creating a collection and playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . at the top of the window there is a running text display , which shows the currently running piece or the current stream . one click on this area changes the display of the already depos@@ ited game time to the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch to the available Analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ Q . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to start the play position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playing and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ Q from the Main Menu or Click the E@@ Q button in the player window . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many functions that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser features three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . the context @-@ browser includes three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok &quot; , &quot; you may notice that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and beside it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this symbol to meet the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; the images can also display any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are dealt with . the images can also display cover images , which have either been downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this interpre@@ ter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing instantly . you can also right click on it and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to playlist .
&quot; when you click on the text sub@@ window , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download scripts from other web pages with the help of even written scripts . if you don &apos;t run any text script , you can choose which to be started . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . this is no running text script necessary .
the Find button opens a search on g@@ oogle.com after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ t / album - first the pieces are sorted according to their interpre@@ t and , among them , a further division is performed after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track records , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ t / year - album - S@@ ort by interpre@@ ter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection will be alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your songs are sorted by genre and under interpre@@ t sorted .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted according to the album below the interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at your finger@@ tips . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you have a lot of pieces , it might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction view . hints for using this filter can be found in the playlist section of this manual . &quot;
&quot; below the search filter there is a selection box , with which help you can filter out the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to one year . of course , you can of course choose your entire collection , which makes the filter practically disabled . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This empty the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on one entry will give you the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e for transfer@@ ring to the media player . for more details , please refer to the Media Player browser section . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this interpre@@ ter burn / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Mark@@ es the selected album as a compilation , and there it appears among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes use of many play@@ lists easily . among other things , he also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the bottom part of the playlist is the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent Play@@ list . there you can type all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer songs to your iPod , drag the songs you want from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will release the pieces on your iPod . if the transfer is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which will not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is a address bar with which you can input music from a given URL . if you want to enter music from a given URL , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the mounting of files can be tri@@ cky by simple drop down . in the case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , falling files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist en@@ lists all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter letters , only the pieces that the characters are included are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing blan@@ ks , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries which Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : valu@@ ation : &gt; 50 . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this is searching for all pieces that either have Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the Ctr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist .
&quot; next , the buttons will follow and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar , there is a unique , increased analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can view in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the corresponding display area . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . also disable the Status bar option in the General settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations from &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
cover management is a useful tool for managing your covers images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to be displayed in the cover administration . choose from :
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your great entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in queu@@ e , a number will be displayed next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
&quot; add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your playlist . you do not need Last@@ .@@ fm profile , so that this dynamic playlist will work . &quot;
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so , you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately complete your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the playlist recommended items will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
&quot; the new button re@@ stores the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist , edit the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you won &apos;t be able to hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under the settings of the play@@ able pieces . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . thus you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you drop multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists added . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Settings .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok script by clicking on script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also download new scripts from the Internet .

&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the incon@@ spic@@ uous effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and can automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and filename for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file save .
&quot; if a project changes and hasn &apos;t been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then throw the closing and keep the project opened . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project stored , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any project not saved will be asked what to do with it , as if you have accessed file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files for adding to the project using the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you have the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , which &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only be used with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it is useful to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you , even if this feature is not used . it is useful for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remo@@ ves files from the medium , it only displays the files previously imported . &quot;
&quot; open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also choose cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; open the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn later . additionally , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;

&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even opportunities to change the size and trim black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the contents view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is checked , a small strip is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment accordingly . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on screen . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task are critical to which the enclosed programs give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG @-@ format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages are already installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while inser@@ tion only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often as often as a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this will result ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; obtain information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , with everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the set @-@ up of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der was configured in the Setup Settings tab in the setup directory - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the Sett@@ ing Settings tab in the Setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others like &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG players is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially only the MP3 format support these devices . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all the pieces of a song . well suited for music of young people , portable devices and Aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo installations . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the keyword ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ TT of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ TT { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = name of a button in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the computer instead . it &apos;s to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note by the translator : this is meant by the author ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less information , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select an address field ( sending an address ) . for the use of Fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration it seems , the email address is not used by the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; when using Fre@@ ed@@ b , the geograph@@ ically closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compens@@ ates the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed , if this has not been done yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the extracted WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about the enco@@ der can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a coding , further information can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help , or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 terms ( Tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you have to install cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have access to it ( eg by trying to copy something into it with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each auth@@ oring &amp; CD ;
here we determine the code to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with each reading of a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the read@@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work , or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the inputs of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map Card General settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as shown as shown in the screen shot . &quot;
&quot; only for incomplete information request , so that you will be informed if data is missing for generating keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the map card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically over the Internet from a Fre@@ ed@@ b Calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the Fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the directory names or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory name or filename is changed with con@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and Fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use Fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to use the database earlier . however , this is about 620 MB big , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is Fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eval of the CD ; information from the Fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about Fre@@ ed@@ b . do everything as shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send a CD ; data to the Fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be de@@ activated . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just try themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if only place on another drive is present . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with WAV files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see anything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of enco@@ ded WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is described and set up in the previous section . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; because we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in Fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots are somewhat different from the data you have fet@@ ched . so you will learn the recording data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen then , in the FAQ section , search for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b could be retri@@ eved , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window pop up , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of Fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can manually dis@@ solve this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box may be used for individual comments in@@ vidu@@ ally per piece ; the album &apos;s comment field is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap , for example , can be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &quot; &quot; OK &quot; , &quot; return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the items for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are picked out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button select the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the program &apos;s status is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message tells you if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this way you can read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy of this . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is already included . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the initial start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it would proceed from this kind of blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , may it do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke games of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has not have a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the toolbar , select entry from the item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; plays a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original temp@@ o , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause or pause the pause in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . hit the space bar while no play is played , starts playing and k@@ mid ; play . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text gra@@ dients and others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event sty@@ p is automatically selected , which uses a song so you do not have to set anything manually . so , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the f@@ ake in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection takes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by button Add . it again appears the file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sequence sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to continue to jump a song , select the Next song button , the record next song from the menu item or press the key arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need any MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your preferred editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all needed translations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END OP@@ TION@@ S ... END
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all the sounds that this instrument is needed to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can play a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , ir@@ respective of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the term dr@@ um@@ ming patch refers to a different perc@@ ussi@@ onist instrument ( drums , cy@@ mb@@ als , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are pic@@ tured on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . look at the supplied key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , simply do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , Patch x is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example in order to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch B@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ blow@@ ing event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button does not illumin@@ ate more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . View the View menu in the Settings menu under the View channel View : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians playing the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot comp@@ el anyone , and k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , activate Autom@@ atically add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or when I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch Auto Add to the collection and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so make the setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue to program . &quot;

&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card except that you can &apos;t hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the website The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ re windows . there is always a window with a central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy . if you want to record an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked record . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category to select from the View menu and next editing mode . by using a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the same menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the Edit Mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ verse option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end @-@ animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ ME ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of S@@ ME . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything has to be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by Mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even embed the special embed embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file will be specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is in a con@@ sol@@ ete application to start and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors appearing here , the back@@ end issue is called cr@@ p@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a given back@@ end is taken for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B contained therein . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of S@@ ME@@ s can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension for the X server must be working in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as a user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drive on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems you probably have access to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical user interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized approach to all &amp; latex . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn his ways , the manual is to be used to K@@ ate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the right pron@@ unci@@ ation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . choose the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; it is not the ultimate book to do so . to master &amp; latex , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the KÃ ¶ r@@ per starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Setup Wiz@@ ard of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : this is the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Letter &#91; letter &#93; , Report &#91; letter &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , script ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , films &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; , or custom . &quot;
encoding : hereby the encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of natural latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; latex ; . for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .

new users don &apos;t need to worry . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; if you see greater areas of a larger text on the screen , it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and stra@@ w r@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; with automatic execution of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates a blank line ( for example \ \ begin { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu configuration k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands to be de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements .
&quot; when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed using a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file is created , navig@@ ating &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the legal output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are joined with the editor and as soon as one element has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; latex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewers jump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . &quot;
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; latex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is taken over from above mentioned signals and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick assembly . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit Tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Modi@@ fiable &amp; latex ; -@@ instructions for parti@@ tioning are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field further is for entries of articles such as keywords , public notes or references . the ver@@ fÃ ¼ g@@ able possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a description for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box possible ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is shown . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; these are only necessary when the file belongs to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down field named size will be used for determining the written image . you can set the fonts for the main text , the loading no@@ des , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the written permission . if the font height does not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source text example has been entered , the &amp; latex must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen oder Kn@@ op@@ fs quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing automatically .
&quot; the compilation of the document is missing , should be searched for errors in logging . if using rapid construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example a report with the written extension e 12 is created and only a few places shall have a different written permission .
the changes are only super@@ vised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes occurring within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , gre@@ ase pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive pressure and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be recur@@ sively described with \ \ u@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; sign language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , mind@@ . a quote , a few places in fat and intensive pressure and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex , for read@@ ability from some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ B@@ inary files . just Modern under Sett@@ ing K@@ ile must be set up ... tools Build .
&quot; to drill pre @-@ search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be cli@@ cked on to default search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
&quot; if using the Quick Production of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not open , an error may occur . if an error occurs , this will be summar@@ ized in the logging file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file declar@@ es the source code in source code . in the editor , the buttons can be used to view La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; k@@ ile ; navig@@ ates to the def@@ ective line . &quot;
&quot; once clicking on the respective button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; real user of &amp; latex , usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded , to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings tile ... settings in general are set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by input in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way the following steps are executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any kind of latex ; files created . in a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and searched through the steps below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and editing of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual for K@@ ate should be drawn . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; latex , and their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word . that means that this way while clicking the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with left left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , with dr@@ illed Shift key can be selected portions of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the different kinds of source tex@@ tes and to empha@@ size these . for example , the colors differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can enter additional jump brands . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries are highlighted by the jump to the next or last jump . in doing so , this jump is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ate ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already outstanding possibilities offers , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands are included for the text selection : &quot;
&quot; with a paragraph there is not a text with consistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning as@@ signs to tables , &amp; latex , -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ ding thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is the fact that the abstr@@ acts are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also contains &amp; latex . -@@ commands with a return line ( * ) and an additional aster@@ isk ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and by pressing the Del key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides the following commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit selected paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in natural latex . therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands in editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment . &quot;
&quot; when the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many w@@ asted ambient commands , quickly the over@@ look can be lost . this command closes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the braces compl@@ aining clamp . &quot;
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex group # it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of welded joint @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps , you can quickly lose sight of the Over@@ seas . this command closes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex , two simple reference marks are used as a guest . for the purpose of implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and takes two close contact signs for natural latex . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double quotes can be set up under Sett@@ ing K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use any specific settings ( e.g. n@@ German or french ) , so that German or French quotes can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when pushing Shift , Enter &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
within a tables environment close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; trying to reach this . although this tab@@ ulator is not the standard , for &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code understanding , it has been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . these are available for different modes of work . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Sett@@ ing K@@ ile ... &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and the complete list will be increased . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jump brands can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be added to these positions using Edit Spr@@ ung@@ marken N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ sten Spr@@ ung@@ marken , and the selected parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Sett@@ ing k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; you can make adjustments to these lists . you can choose different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex , -@@ commands as well as well @-@ being of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for performing environments . there is always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the call of complete destruction will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for performing the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ length open @-@ out mode or the Alt + Shift key , the command to initi@@ ate the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature res@@ umes in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key can be termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; after this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a listing environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
under Sett@@ ing k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; perform settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of files of the complete compensation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by foreign strings . the lists can be set up under Sett@@ ing K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , when the L input character is entered and the word ampli@@ fied by the menu Ctr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ ert@@ aste is introduced , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large wai@@ st@@ band are not helpful for automatic performance . however , it has been noted that many weighing systems are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete satisfaction for all already written messages . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu Sett@@ ing K@@ ile ... tile res@@ e@@ aled . here , the threshold for the display of the complete damage can also be set here . &quot;
the complete editing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder .
the dialog graphic shapes shapes the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to the clear@@ er view of the basics to the graphics formats the sections should be taken into account .
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is called , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to enable the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed group@@ ingly in the menu creation , comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after compile . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when fil@@ ing the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; a fully transparent refl@@ ector for &amp; tex ; and default modes are described instead . rather , it is a complete description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and here a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; k@@ ile ; is also a part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different sig@@ natur@@ es for emails . the signature interface provides random sig@@ natur@@ es or daily sig@@ natur@@ es from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natur@@ es for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail .
&quot; for random sig@@ natur@@ es , any signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig ; read . by many sig@@ natur@@ es with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natur@@ es , the same signature is read from the signature file for all day . for each day you use different sig@@ natur@@ es , as with the random sig@@ natur@@ es create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty sig@@ natur@@ es ; in the Sign@@ atures section . click on &amp; lt ; empty Sign@@ atures ; in the section Sign@@ atures . click on &amp; lt ; then save it with Ctr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the Save icon Save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natur@@ es as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natur@@ es for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always sufficient sig@@ natur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar . &quot;

&quot; the various tools are available via the de@@ bug@@ ging menu , whereby the Insp@@ ector tool is most important . &quot;
clicking on a grad@@ ual guide in the menu displays a dialog for selecting the cutting speed .
&quot; to stop the process , press the W button or select step by step in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to consult a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System ID ... in the menu and enter the searched value in the displayed dialog . &quot;
&quot; to stop a Public@@ ID , select the Public@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the searched value in the dialog indicated . &quot;
&quot; if the Insp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; files included by the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking a source entry in the shown list puts the text po@@ inter in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the Insp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
&quot; all found templates are listed here . it is important to note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T apply . therefore , multiple templates can be present with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template entry in the shown list moves the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map card in the X@@ sl@@ db@@ g Insp@@ ector dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared .
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a given expression , for example &quot;
&quot; then , a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the expression expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text po@@ inter will be moved in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are used as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ lay . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . raise it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the rated working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the folder you want in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , they just leave the current working folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date working folders and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is def@@ ective . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then leave the current file easily . if not , they delete the tick on current file and select the file to be checked using another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check option . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) and enter the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; using definitions URI ; file selection . both for &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the Defini@@ tions URI ; in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file easily . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be working with the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; load , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone finds the f@@ ake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as squ@@ ee@@ zed . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold for which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitudes of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : there can be an event for information to the team leaders when something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs in the project . an example would be the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so that later if a file is saved , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page Event Configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comm@@ ent@@ aries by the following things :
to enter comments is simple . it can be either select the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the inserted nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of b@@ ump@@ y or lo@@ wer@@ case but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , which is agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up with Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . entries are :
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if hoo@@ ked , will be inserted for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatic start and end @-@ tag automatically : if switched on , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during entry .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using button Standard can re@@ produce the default templates .
standard encoding : encoding of newly created or modified files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; perio@@ dic@@ ally create backup copies , so that during a black@@ out or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s view ( or the documentation in a map editor ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set window settings to the default while the next start is useful when the user interface ends by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / dependen@@ cy of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of war@@ nings by hook @-@ up of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which depic@@ ts the figure of the par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; structure Tree Settings allows the visibility of no@@ des in the tree to automatically open the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which there is no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means that there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; to load the component in the &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ entations about plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin available , support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin check@@ box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view where all tie points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown by the de@@ bug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug recei@@ vers . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bug@@ ger , so that in the normal case it does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; displays the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued . if this happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution runs on . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution starts when a requirement is set . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; as@@ signs the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the statement and go to the next , as if there were not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document types Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for brand and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages , respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag files contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Properties dialog . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without any risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders have the name of the description language and version so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc . this is an only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the Tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group the elements of a list together . it can only occur once . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can be used for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the Tools dialog is available at the top in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
in the following one example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it , re@@ achable via D@@ TD working D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ name . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned keyboard short@@ cut . clicking the Custom button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut short@@ cut is removable .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action sty@@ p . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on it it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , even are the quick@@ start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , which should be written to the standard output output , by setting the value the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar added is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose Pre@@ ferences actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Grap@@ h other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start means , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green usually becomes loose , sti@@ ff , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups .
&quot; I &apos;d like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by test all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; backup in the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the right folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust her &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will be ) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ atting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , we will treat the second part here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html second@@ 2 = func@@ tionally func@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ .html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents ( # G@@ etting Start@@ ed ) # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction ...
note the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the depth of chess ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders are shown ! ) . &quot;
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resource files . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script displays the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation is displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository . they will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or other whom . at various locations , you can send a menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , email , toolbar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team needs them as accurate and us@@ ef@@ ull for publication . to make an article &apos;s article we recommend that the resource &apos;s origin is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be left empty ) and by clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar toolbar , and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . in case of problems , it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be created in tag@@ XML format . there is the sim@@ pler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from D@@ TD menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
destination directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and understand the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the division is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from toolbar to actions , everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool boxes with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the tree view , the map file with information and the tool bar . please suggest , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , other or all card leaders , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another context menu on the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the toolbar displays the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of toolbar buttons is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the site views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate , open and strip in the information . in the presentation with map conductors are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , upload or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more about templates can be found . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works here . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . &quot;
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element it opens a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ hood can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content aligned to the content allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each running script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in that window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool boxes are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool bar as a compressed t@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the configure script . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder lies . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand @-@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop@@ es , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to lever@@ age intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and toolbar , automation is able to increase almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly become a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers reli@@ ed the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file , which is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , there contained special characters for &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; Description , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the An@@ ker tag . &quot;
&quot; switches the block selection to or off , which allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
go directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger .
switching and turning on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structural tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is ad@@ ministered . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
loading a project toolbar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions need to be saved using settings actions , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the field of view . this delet@@ es it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endix .
enables up@@ loading of toolbar to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
invite a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
refres@@ h / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; . is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder fails .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied when this tag continues to contradi@@ ct the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in is disabled . &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available list schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line marker . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog include any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can change sequences and change sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le.com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; allow files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good things . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the sub@@ window profiles or using the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the above , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the de@@ bug@@ ger to be selected . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles upload high loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing a custom site view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can turn off event actions and add or delete event actions , change or delete events . events will be executed when a particular event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project you can open project ... from the Project or the Project icon open from the toolbar . the dialog will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders behave similarly , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button . &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is termin@@ ated to prevent removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it can &apos;t be read simply , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. through simple de@@ bit of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool boxes in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preferably designed via the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action can be created , ren@@ aming tool bar ren@@ aming or toolbar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries action will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set up settings actions ..
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sc@@ opes and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a usual fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or merge any existing directory into the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in some the restrictions you set for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with img src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for complete websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template Save As a local template . &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template does not appear in the project tree . look at the storage space below project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the site view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste via the con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files tree view , you can select a folder on the right and create site template to save and secure a name for the template . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep track of some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window Templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a sel@@ ector box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ inded as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes are inher@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template chart . if a root folder is set , it would appear in principle in this path unless it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows leading or reproduced text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button press ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cursor is displayed . then you can edit and switch back when needed to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active . pressing F@@ 9 is already active , the key@@ press moves the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is retained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the encoding of the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
Meta tags allow saving information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content such as keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content -@@ column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is like in a text processing , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , and by using a back button or remove key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other da@@ zz@@ ling tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Li@@ sts Assistant , are de@@ activated . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists must be used in this release . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for study of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed .
&quot; to be able to compile successfully , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a file name without path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded still template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is , for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had a lot of changes in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to frequently check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anno@@ y@@ ance more if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the filename of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der
&quot; open dialog will allow for manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences will be done with two files . &quot;
&quot; the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge of folders will be introduced . however , if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filename from A in both other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set a output file . you can do this step later during storage . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you need to create two corresponding files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant for pre@@ processor and in few rare individual cases ) . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line divi@@ ding the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the compar@@ ative window ) has also an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to solve next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two windows are used , any difference at the same time must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , no more line remains in the group by automatic merge or manually editing ; then it is displayed in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; No line in the source ; no line is displayed in the queu@@ e ; this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ version conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully , go with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , r@@ unter , page on , page from beginning , end , Ctr@@ l start and Ctr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in section merge and edi@@ table display window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ below / Ctr@@ l @-@ above ) or to the next / previous dis@@ advantage ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Image Up / Str@@ g @-@ Image descending ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to automatically copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and manually copied it . be careful with this option but be careful because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ return \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered more ast@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the entry of the preceding line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board then . &quot;
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical rows in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes may be treated like a white sign . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensively searching for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic res@@ sing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C function for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g is attached . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
the encoding type for the encoding gives a brief indication of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply aper@@ ture the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . the current file merge in the merge menu works even if you just compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as pres@@ et name for output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it first is passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when new@@ line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to provide the user more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to turn the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing expression of the text found on each string and therefore all characters in one line refer to the found text in the first clamp section . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
&quot; CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword , because $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line compensation suitable . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ding / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &quot; &quot; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) you need per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ com@@ er al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hiding differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can sim@@ ulate mer@@ ging and shows sim@@ ulated changes without really carrying them out
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not merge . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files will be listed that were compared until then . &quot;
when scanning the folder shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan will be displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure normally is folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the coll@@ ision action cannot be automatically selected . if the mer@@ ging is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above image , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C column . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : contradi@@ c@@ tory files . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : contradi@@ c@@ tory files . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist can &apos;t be started .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder has been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged , and selecting the newer file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) is checked , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file is processed by the other . you state @-@ column shows skill when the mer@@ ging is successful , and correspon@@ dingly other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is al@@ right everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected item ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then the three folder merge mode C is used as the target , in the two folder mer@@ ging B is chosen as the destination and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , check if all entries that should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge or continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only select the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid merge actions by contradi@@ c@@ tory file types , a message appears that points to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with options , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes , then you will receive a complete list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will proceed ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will have the option to select another action for entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again later . even if you have ski@@ pped the merge action , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Setup ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the indicated pattern are displayed in the El@@ em@@ ental Tree . multiple patterns can be entered . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the El@@ em@@ ental Tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the El@@ em@@ ental Tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignore files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set by a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the El@@ em@@ ental Tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is disabled , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not to consider possible recur@@ sions ) . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use cau@@ tion . this option is de@@ prec@@ ated in default . &quot;
the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful for example when copying the ch@@ angel@@ og . please use cau@@ tion . this option is de@@ prec@@ ated in default .
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for merge files are stored in the same way that afterwards both folders are stored . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are any differences , instead of linking the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered to be un@@ certain , as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the folder &amp; text windows in the pop @-@ up window and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; most likely you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a menu item in the directory . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is assumed as a link @-@ target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way of editing per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . ) &quot;
&quot; at present , the main purpose of use is as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , the input file is a patch file in the unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools named K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ s ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I am using GPL softwares for a very long time and learned a lot by having looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have walked this path or take it like this .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script is probably not the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure is installed in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for user interfaces ( e.@@ g k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not treated as identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this actually is braces dence but this entry is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor speci@@ fies for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to create a conflict easily by clicking in the source and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
&quot; after removing the text , it suddenly stops ; No src has left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de , 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with compile . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re@@ write the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are shown . this also causes identical files when mer@@ ging cannot be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , to change their size , to quit them or move them . this works in both a working area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; when clicking on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other des@@ kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the name of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with key numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; c@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rect@@ angles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally drops &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display and move the windows as symbols or with their content .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; followed by selecting swit@@ chers ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; k@@ edit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any writing rights for the file , you need to log in as a user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users , such as artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ments . this application is a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ like ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window will be viewed as a magni@@ fier window . the image , which is displayed in the magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag , the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; for this you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window ) or the setting of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that this is not able to detect the form of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fier window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , push the &amp; Shift key ; push the &amp; M@@ MB ; using , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rot@@ ate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
&quot; choose the refres@@ h rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refres@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your selected short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the button document once again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Zoom &amp; etc . &quot;
k@@ like also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter gets lost in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Str@@ ain @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which any mouse click pain prepar@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter gets lost in the same place . it is meant to help people who want to em@@ ulate the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Str@@ ain In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that any mouse click pain prepar@@ es . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain , which results in clicking with the mouse , it is us@@ eless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic assist@@ ants , the result can fall for each different . &quot;
use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly .
&quot; the intelligent delay is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulates pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before rele@@ asing the mouse button . the intelligent delay requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this delay time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; if it is switched on , the script is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ress the mouse button is waiting , before it takes the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place . &quot;
&quot; this feature is enabled in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but it can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Rider General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all the settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset after the last push of users . &quot;
&quot; first use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shifting should first be switched off . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later gain the intelligent shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click with no effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scr@@ ape with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shifting , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer finish by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click . this will return the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral zone of desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart sliding , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to select text to copy it to the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action where you will probably have problems with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
do not use smart sliding if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use . select text instead : hold a mouse button at the end of the text and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . thus , each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time begins when intelligent shifting . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X @-@ Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which the an@@ tigen of the p@@ ines p@@ ains p@@ ains .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process starts , before rele@@ asing the mouse button . thus , drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for wor@@ ter@@ ers . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each language . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only correctly liter@@ ate words can be taken into the wor@@ m@@ hole . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sent@@ ences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a run@@ time memory of the already spoken sent@@ ences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; when you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sent@@ ences in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the cache . you can select from it sent@@ ences which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the Page Wor@@ ter@@ ers and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the Card input voice output , type the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the voice generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if that is successful , the other settings are ignored on this page . the kt@@ ori@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage from the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; when selecting In the input field , the selected text passage is transferred directly into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second check@@ box Close of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you select changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . if you choose any changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if you want to save the text@@ book . &quot;
the dictionary page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ector box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box you can select the currently used dictionary for wor@@ ding .
&quot; using the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; then , select the language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined and how these are to be weight@@ ed .
&quot; with this option , create a new empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar , or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text cut is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the storage buffer . &quot;
&quot; the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text cut is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the storage buffer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the storage buffer . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a mo@@ vable tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved directly under the menu bar by default . clicking on the hat@@ ching left side and drag can move the toolbar to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when not cross , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a mo@@ vable list for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the language output voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax doesn &apos;t like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . hence , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send the data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice @-@ output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text by the computer . it is stored a list of spoken phrases which the user can always re@@ produce . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language edition system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is an consisting of modules of existing service that allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ overs ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications . &quot;
&quot; the speech output is done via the program speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or using shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; tool .
&quot; in ZU@@ KUN@@ FT : support for Speech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ SML ) , and Speech Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Speech ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; D@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ori@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ edit mailing list . subscribe to the list on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ los@@ . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Kanal # k@@ de @-@ Import ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and configure the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; on the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card is shown in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the ticket counter speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card controller is displayed . it will appear automatically when you launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker .
&quot; with a click , select a spokes@@ man from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click , select a spokes@@ man from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click , select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; leaf@@ let system .
&quot; select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a female voice and girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map tab and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text orders to create and manage text jobs . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can select the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map rider General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; tick this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see . remove the marking , is stopped K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the control bar system area , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start , stop , stop and record text orders . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders are only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map rider General and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text you want to read and then select the text you want to read , and then select the text to read before . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; header lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text displayed . first check whether &amp; leaf@@ s ; then check the text you want to read , and then select the text you want to read and then select the language output . &quot;

&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; , which you notified of events specified by you . you can read the text of this message also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu Sett@@ ing this program . the here possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is provided by &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filtering is edited by text before being sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace fal@@ si@@ fied words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders are continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you request from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ ite is an example of an application that uses text applications . text orders are intended for the output longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; t@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be more kinds of filters .
replace strings replace parts of a text by other text . the replacing parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string substitute filters like : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
&quot; if you have sent a female voice to a speaker , for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules for which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a code ; email notification is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the filter type , and the details below are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for setting string replac@@ ements , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string generated from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages by clicking the &amp; Ctr@@ l key . &quot;
&quot; if the text is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs are available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers have to be om@@ itted . if for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only use copies . &quot;
&quot; if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ations ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Expres@@ sions are available in the package am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ aker Selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; transfer@@ ring a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the Spe@@ aker features that the program dire@@ cts the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the Spe@@ aker set up on the card reader . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the elected spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; if the text is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text comp@@ lies the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is chosen to meet the required requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your ch@@ amp settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Selection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must have at least one condition .
&quot; the Voice Output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with program@@ mers can give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output media via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from kt@@ ori@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . start kt@@ ori@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; XML ; form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to use SA@@ BLE at all . you must also do that if you don &apos;t have this voice to read from websites . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to be found via the PAT@@ H environment variable . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors to the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are out@@ spr@@ inkl@@ ed or only Cau@@ ter@@ wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be resolved by a string substitute filter . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a console .
&quot; the list of languages above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bars , or have downloaded any of the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; . &quot; the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr program is to be further developed so that the installation of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sent@@ ences . the user can leave sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or ab@@ ort the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker , you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , look in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add to Add to Add or click on the map or click Edit button , the card controller setup will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown in the following . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to festival . in case of voices that are known , this setting is automatically done . in general , Western languages are using ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slider controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the syn@@ thes@@ ized language . if you can &apos;t select a few kno@@ bs and display this grey , the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; a number of voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when you start K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker set up ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently edited pro@@ position . the Spe@@ aker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can proceed or withdraw from the order , which is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on the OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be copied to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system is not installed ; instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de instead , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; there are only text assign@@ ments listed and managed . expendi@@ tures from screen @-@ readers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled and t@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ EUR % , roughly the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; leaf@@ let system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output queu@@ es in queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map apply only to normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , war@@ nings , and the expenditure of screen readers , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start reading with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; tick this check box to to@@ ggle the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; do not read noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; ct@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the features of the requested subscri@@ ber . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed as top entry in the list on the card board . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action will be defined for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the notification to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Clear . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voice , voice velocity , voice , voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ kHz , SS@@ ML @-@ Text is usually pronounced very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds can start or pause or stop orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional det@@ ectors filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional det@@ ecting filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way to learn the setting up of the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and enter text for reading . switch off the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal sentence det@@ ecting filter is automatically set up when you launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just be removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; set limits recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions , and add a tab@@ ulator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ulated characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you removed from Ver@@ sehen the normal sentence det@@ ecting filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; ct@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card card , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use the most appropriate subscri@@ ber that displays all the features of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber settings , select &amp; t@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker , which is closest to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the requested subscri@@ ber here . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the language used in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the features in the area of speaker , the most likely to delete the following , click the standard speaker button and then use it to the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last word order in queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr immediately cr@@ ashes when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get any trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that states : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find references for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estival@@ int / voices add the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; ct@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML transform@@ er@@ filter , and set up the talk speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; t@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . therefore , the x@@ s@@ l file is not producing errors , the x@@ s@@ l file to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own character encoding filter , and now I can proceed in &amp; t@@ ts ; no more sub@@ - or back@@ wards . on the top of the card , orders are displayed , the job exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pro@@ position recognition instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by calling G@@ Stre@@ amer ( http : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( http : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setup of the speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most of the Linux ; CDs already included .
&quot; download the tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from the sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ g. echo kt@@ ori@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ori@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to limitations when passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . it generates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts di@@ ph@@ one@@ . more information can be found here .
&quot; with this procedure additional wr@@ ap@@ per code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS English Festival is a changed version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . it is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E in the package that you have downloaded . ( for using with Festival 2.0 , it is not necessary to re@@ compile the bug fixes ) . then insert the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm . &quot;

&quot; on some systems you have to edit the / etc / f@@ estival@@ .@@ s@@ cm file . just add the lines for your installed German voices . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to express the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; first and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then invite Festival @-@ Czech by
un@@ pack the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the GNU / Linux distri@@ butions . find Fl@@ ite as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage language syn@@ thesizer , which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language syn@@ thesizer generates the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ap@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the filename . &quot;
&quot; on the card board setting , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right . &quot;
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it &apos;s a simple language syn@@ thesizer with an even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; launch kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the Card Board Spe@@ aker click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ OS T@@ TS voice syn@@ thesizer . if the Epo@@ s programs do not appear in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card controller . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you have to install the Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither pitch , volume nor talk speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be activated on the command line . &quot;
&quot; preferably use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; for the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network features possible . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded , when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the dealer choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . before , all options are shown gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the tab network interfaces :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface ... to be edited in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Extended configuration displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; when selecting Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . &quot;
&quot; using Manual can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on your needs . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and click the interface ... &quot;
&quot; establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is asking http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS replaces this name in an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the host name resolution part of the File Name Resolution allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ grading in the list with buttons up or down in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
usually the list of well @-@ known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are still in the test .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... Add New alias dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the additional alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... Modi@@ fy your computer to edit .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , it needs to be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command will be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical user interface such as package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to prevail in the near future . this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that can be used to assign a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway . &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ direction . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local one machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically in case of DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical user interface for UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system and for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and closed . &quot;
&quot; in case of a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not shown and listed under the description will be disabled . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed above . in a de@@ activated variable it is de@@ activated as a description .
&quot; to create a new task first , select the tasks folder first . then go to Edit New .... alternatively , you can also right click on the Edit menu and then press Ctr@@ l ; N to press . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; when you specify both the month &apos;s day ( s ) as well as weekday ( s ) , the task will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , regardless of the day of the day , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the cr@@ ont@@ ab has been saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to Edit check@@ out . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select out , or press Ctr@@ l ; X . &quot;

&quot; it appears the standard k@@ de ; -@@ printing dialog . if you choose to check out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; use the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the time sched@@ ules of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast and sel@@ ective packaging . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you backup ?
&quot; before a tape can be used , it needs to be included in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat@@ or ; trains the tape back and reads the ledge information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat@@ or , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat@@ er ; the pre @-@ spell , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by r@@ apping the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band by &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it needs to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not match the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not require form@@ atting the tape before using the tape . flo@@ ppy drives usually require form@@ atting the tape , DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape do not get lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the f@@ use dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry check ....
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , dialog for verification will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog will be reviewed . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can occur in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select from the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the index file by means of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected Working Fol@@ der .
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files located on the same file system are stored in the same file system as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be stored separately in backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted and ch@@ dat ; before the tape em@@ beds the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat@@ or to lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . maybe this setting will not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the integration of &amp; k@@ dat@@ or will be dis@@ car@@ ded automatically . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy registry . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must inform the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only contain one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar files that can be managed directly with GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; - Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and analysed . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of the sys@@ log server and Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably do not have started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually not found in the / var / log folder , for normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ erion , or after entered strings . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then offset with the entries in the selected column . for example , select the process name in the log file system log , and then insert the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in default , and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as minutes @-@ lines of the level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut down in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter Panel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the pop @-@ up window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu to view it . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org@@ .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program startup when running the system in Linux , world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD style . &quot;
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and reform@@ atting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly into / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start running the system or switching to another round level . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , http@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different points after the program and starts the first one to find .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runner level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and fix the 3 . if you want to change it , you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop , and you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop http@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could be &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level running only http@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; etc ; boot , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of availability system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and then insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore records thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with Insert ( using Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press Enter key to open the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; otherwise they are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine will start constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for execution at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed from the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and http@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
