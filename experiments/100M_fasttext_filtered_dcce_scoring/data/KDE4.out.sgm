<seg id="9">"you should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; before you compile it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"to use the crash module, click in & konqueror; click on Tools. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes if existing."</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Connection Filter (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras pane filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">Module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbar and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing a nested folder hierarchies using a so-called Tree Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property, that the sum of the sizes of the sub-ordered objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size of a folder represents the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; command you are considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; an entry in the TrePlus representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles own useful color imaging and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched on by view color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles can be used (which, as a result, specify the relative position of the inscription on the rectangle)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of presentation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the tremor in & FSView; this goal is not always kept. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoiding space losses due to the frame, that rectangles are created, which are as quadratic. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View stop by area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitie; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digitized;</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digitized; is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for registering in the developer mailing list by & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & digitized; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. this path will be stored for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digitized; will also use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digikam set up collections"</seg>

<seg id="68">"& digitized; requested recursively the library path throughout its entire depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it is in hidden folders. this can be done by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist have no photos than symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digip; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderAdjustors and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digi.com."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk device. the camera will also be used as a disk drive. the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may connect to the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digitized; uses the gPhoto2 program for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed protocol for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digicame; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the preview images can be read from digitiphoto2 camera drivers to read thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicame; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digitized;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in almost any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digicame; themselves perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or change in full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, data list, or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is used only for the fields, which are currently displayed in the toolbar. thus, the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed on the toolbar, and which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are stored in a single nightmare. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the albends or after the date the album was first created. the date can be changed in the album's properties."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. just select all the photos and move it to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to click on the album and edit the album properties context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums, so you can be grouped by a common name."</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons elder, average, new ester: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the passage of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first open an album in & digitized, the first picture is chosen in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select" "Set As Albumvorschau". "in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be scanned.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitized; supports input of keywords for single photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window will display the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures are displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these thumbnails with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"if you open an album the first time, you need to wait short while the preview images are generated. this can be avoided, in which you can recreate all thumbnails in the Extras menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is, can be changed using the digitized settings. select the Albums tab here and adjust the area thumbnails to your wishes."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help window that appears. when you leave the mouse pointer at a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can choose from the viewing menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit.... in the digitized image processing you can view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">"it can happen that & digicame; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by checking the context menu with right mouse button and selecting the program from the Open Menu program. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"you should note that after editing, other image processing programs can come to problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. therefore, this information is lost from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitized; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnails to preview and turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>

<seg id="110">"if a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by this, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also collapse parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; collapse so that you can easily find the keywords you're looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the subtitle of this keyword."</seg>

<seg id="149">"if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use not & digitized;. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use not & digitized;. the approach to store metadata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you do and need to know before you manage something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime."</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you're making enough photos then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, synchronize, automatic contrast and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity value over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method adjusts the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the same number of pixels makes it possible to improve the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that works miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast Increase: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB value of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jioping of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balancing algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it through the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the upper right a histogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also digest."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. this will display the combined result in the white balance. this is shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Store do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button presets all filter values back to its default values and the neutral white balance. note that, even neutral settings will give a different photo than your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping may be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Key Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to always use the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual on tone correction, you will find further information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitized; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar installation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of the image. the coloured, dark areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to finely adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar energy. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so called" "Velviaquot" "effect. it differs from saturation by making it a more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes a lot of photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon Filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you can use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo at low light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to consider saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple candlestick / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purposes explained here. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders into which are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can see the original and preview of the picture. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, and the following options are available on the left."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic separation is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three colour pinouts can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values enable the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to manipulate the output values, for example, to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons the set values in the filesystem can be saved and loaded later. the Gimp Levels Format will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. select the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the Overexposure Indicator option controls all the color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the light tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark output oils and which become the associated pixel darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve showing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces particularly in dark areas."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blur mask works on the contrast of edges to let a picture look sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric smoke and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must be summarized with only minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use an edge finder already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry corrigation sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should avoid caution because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen a picture refocus the tool. you can achieve more information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool for using the menu entry corrigate softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in radius or amount will increase the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats are generated near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should sharpen shots best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture which is added to the original. this will set the sharpness of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimal difference in this way for a channel of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are exempted from sharpening and therefore avoided selflaws in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result from the source pixel which is far from the original pixel, which results in most cases very strongly from the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected by 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"ash'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß ash sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is' sch. this is most often caused by a previously executed unsharpening filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size may generate good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the gauss, but in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave uncomfortable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, invisible mascers must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Wiener Filter, it's always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto Focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods used to focus on digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust filter settings fine, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of space in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulenzeffekt it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running through. normally there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradation da [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles make a long run time. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral stepwidth in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the increase of quality that you get by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Store do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce billet noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor sounds from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings can remain with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel spacing to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerances of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas, which are typically more roughed up. however, it also does not pollute the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"cushioning: controls the alignment of the phase absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for using the menu entry corrigate softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>

<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce compression: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm it generates some compression & quot; artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in an uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Store do exactly this. any setting of photo-restoration can be saved into a text file and recharged later.</seg>

<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and color or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image used without this filter. the tool for vignetting is used by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light gain at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture adjustment of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2, or accidentally elevate the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of pixels. you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="649">"the settings of the assembling help allow you to show help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic pitches are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-regel, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"Golden centre: the golden center is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blades of a sunflower. it emerges in all possible things we perceive as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line of being without the eye, it will fulfill its purpose."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the centerpoints of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a uniform triangles. diagonal to these lines can be seen a static object dynamically."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal flip and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button Color, you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>

<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only permits a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion using the output button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture that are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have the option to overwrite existing file automatically. however, this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling reduces the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is still further divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels will be processed with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed separately and be checked for further classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called jittering. if you switch Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had a lot of changes in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3, almost into a fully-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no annoyance more if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you need to create two corresponding files, download them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches your needs."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it first is passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only when newline. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to provide the user more flexibility in setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users don't want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to turn the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a merchandising expression of the text found on each string and therefore all characters in one line refer to the found text in the first clamp section. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">"CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword, because $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line compensation suitable. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted. "</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erding / SCHALTER" "However, perl needs only a few details. where sed\\ (and\\) you need perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for the display and merging. further operations only change the data that the newcomer algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hiding differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program startup when running the system in Linux, world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD style."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and reformatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly into / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start running the system or switching to another round level. system services do not include such things like setserial, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are based on rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different points after the program and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runner level 3 is. if you want to change it, you can edit / etc / inittab manually and fix the 3. if you want to change it, you can fix it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop, and you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could be & eg; a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could have a user -runlevel, the & etc; boot, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and then insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore records thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with Insert (using Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press Enter key to open the properties dialog. use the tabulator key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; otherwise they are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
