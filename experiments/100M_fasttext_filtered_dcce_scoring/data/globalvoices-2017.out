&quot; although I had visited the U.S. since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily big .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 year old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who assisted by Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura co@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of a oil @-@ magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very s@@ warming love letter written about his size .
then hit Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won by the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number that had ever achieved a nom@@ in@@ ee nom@@ in@@ ee nom@@ in@@ ee . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that people from all over the world record , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ umps world view also did not match the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns game .
&quot; in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still goes to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bo@@ died by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ inate republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confront@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to label the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to categ@@ or@@ ise people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful , and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cru@@ el decision to lift up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( note of O@@ Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebel@@ lion against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; words from white in all@@ usion on the wh@@ ites and W@@ hi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones called , has exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r K@@ han , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. K@@ han had a correspondence with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. K@@ han . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; hat@@ s the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. K@@ han concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. K@@ han could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what did the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commun@@ e in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , with their musical instruments a way to overcome them surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; but after a random meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you are always laugh@@ ing and playing with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from waste
&quot; more than 7@@ .000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a where the recycl@@ ers have started trans@@ forming parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , is remin@@ is@@ cent of the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not interact with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ manufactured material and that &apos;s called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about 1 billion tonnes of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
the fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play of rub@@ b@@ ish music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can effectively combat illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in the waters of illegal fishing before the other coast of Africa was looking for . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this type on their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles were swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to inv@@ ade one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that had simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members a leading co @-@ worker of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at his time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the Premier out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are equ@@ alized and working together . they exchange information and stand each other at where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the Le@@ v Char@@ itable Trust &apos;s project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is conce@@ aled , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspic@@ ious voy@@ ages can be discovered - such as suggest@@ ing that a ship cor@@ ro@@ de his caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license , where they were on the move , and possibly whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financi@@ ally no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD lost in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as coast@@ ing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , st@@ ating fant@@ asi@@ en@@ ae , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of the missing international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You cannot run my harbour . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
&quot; it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had spread f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has persec@@ uted and found escap@@ ing ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , FISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to pick up the illegal vessels that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Financial Officer at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be used by satell@@ ites .
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it aims to help FISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ ques@@ tion@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; getting together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that &apos;s just a sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project , with which a global system permits the pursu@@ it of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities can not only detect crimin@@ als , but also fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to be fishing without license earlier and hardly had consequences , know now that they will be observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i have meanwhile a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fisher@@ boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after a FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to trace Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found locks there on board drag@@ net networks , whose use was prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty the aim of even more such initiatives and structures can be created in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member country could report his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also enc@@ amped in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of reg@@ ain the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are deemed to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes ran the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , ran into the void by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rec@@ er@@ tification of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the neighboring regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute short@@ age of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end , the rel@@ u@@ ctance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government decree as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and winn@@ ings belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a gra@@ vit@@ ational and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine consists , the referendum is considered to be the only way to give the country a chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ oral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad meets á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , following the elections of 2015 for the majority of representatives of the opposition . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ lowing Day and a march to the Mir@@ af@@ lor@@ es Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , will continue to continue the blocking of the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter by other things as follows :
&quot; Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil war and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mir@@ af@@ lor@@ es Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the Action Programme &quot; The Rec@@ on@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testi@@ fy among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with police officers and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
one of the most often shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the sh@@ ields : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ?
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; cry out this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images circul@@ ate about conflicts , as well as reports of repres@@ sion and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news of police repres@@ sion in the central north of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and the supporters of the government . &quot;
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely but the protests continued .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no sk@@ irts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ rets didn &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is making the turn that forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a term exchange procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natur@@ es are f@@ ake .
here is your removal of ministry !
on the road !
&quot; others are evalu@@ ating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who , from their point of view , made little action against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and rather pre@@ occupied critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing increasing frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not look for his life .
&quot; he started to bear the same name as his father to the brutal military per@@ missions in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; I could not yet know that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer , and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the sec@@ rec@@ y department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , charged with kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had witnessed the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power has a parent on his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy , made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP friends . &quot;
pass only that they do not kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueblo - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party in Argentina .
&quot; for this reason he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the Sports Hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become obe@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because my father had educated me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prison@@ er .
&quot; these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me four times in La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he ordered me to desc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ aw@@ ed in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they put an end to a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was right there .
&quot; they un@@ tied a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ flow@@ ed him with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the st@@ ench there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell instantly and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this od@@ our .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people rested on the mat@@ tresses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I de@@ pressed &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my dad told me at home .
beside La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came to be mis@@ placed . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they did - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , - I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ onet or perhaps military badge , which one pic@@ ks up with an enemy that one fought . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .
clos@@ eup
&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the head of security forces , could carry with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied : and you , who stal@@ ked cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you self @-@ handed . &quot;
we need nobody else to do so !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I carried a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover out of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
&quot; at that time , the defence , a conspir@@ acy , accused me of being a conspir@@ acy of this crime . I suffered no problem , they can lay me the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testi@@ fy .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last hein@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ t@@ table . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to whom one could give up their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last horri@@ ble act that man can do to man .
&quot; my dad told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they picked up machines to er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prison@@ er . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but of course , anything remains . &quot;
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
&quot; the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him alleg@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; suppos@@ edly def@@ ended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horri@@ ble crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I returned the first advertisement .
I finally realized he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest , standing before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 416 crimes : among them severe , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases of det@@ ention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were contradictions . &quot;
eleven of the initially 54 accused died during the trial .

Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the chamber :

&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were mur@@ dered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was , so that there was a memorial to be established there , which is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot;

adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in Kyoto &apos;s Japanese city , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , last month witnessed a very mis@@ fortun@@ ate translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word Av@@ antage escaped from ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sh@@ a ) which means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly - but also with bad h@@ ind @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
&quot; adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Daily Newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto , just un@@ acceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate drivers &quot; drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that elderly people felt ins@@ ul@@ ted by the in@@ adequate correc@@ tions ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are nation@@ wide in accidents , but quite occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors had risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known repor@@ ter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older mot@@ orists are : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous , the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ ride , you need two important abilities : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , nevertheless make translations fir@@ men@@ internally . then the Japanese worker , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ati@@ m and mysterious pro@@ positions which arise by machine translation demonstrate that this technique cannot replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the mysterious prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors like jewellery is still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . however , by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto will hopefully continue to use a serial source for their translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and c@@ ens@@ ors on the internet and television
&quot; home page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fen ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; also other online broad@@ cast@@ ers contributed recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who opp@@ ose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have logged in to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more on @-@ line transm@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; previous investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds error or deny the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Flor@@ es was defeated while he was in police cu@@ sto@@ dy .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the Internet connections are regulated : the Venezu@@ el@@ ans are increasingly difficult to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will become slaves to receive education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witnesses of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became exactly the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a brief report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Fall Schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her minor son or her minor daughter to another , weal@@ th@@ ier family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls have been affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the sense of gratitude which is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees generally silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who supports her daughter in the belief that she can shut down her training , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of himself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with herself and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have no education , and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will experience it only a few years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed signs of heavy blow@@ s . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra beat on Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neigh@@ bors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to trial . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
it had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for instance , cleaned the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to star@@ ve , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembered . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party belonging to the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and to read the editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueblo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought it intellig@@ ently , but did not inter@@ fere with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who list@@ ened while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; learn bad habits there again . &quot; they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home Guar@@ an@@ í back home . &quot;

the society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share posts for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote she had a el@@ f@@ ty girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then , the author of the advertisement was switched on again : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was closed .

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament members recently agreed to &quot; &quot; the regulations governing the use and use of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is entrusted with it to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register with their right names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months j@@ ail or a cash bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de &quot; application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they are supposed to do those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are sc@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; commented Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt heavily on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they pret@@ end that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could be done online too . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , this means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to supply them to a court . &quot;
&quot; this is technically by no means realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative powers of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians suggested a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong prison sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natural guard protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in Iraq &apos;s war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ in@@ arian H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are attemp@@ ting to protect the ster@@ ile Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem will also depend on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is minimal and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she is also a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; &quot; triple cat@@ astrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had caused the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate have been evacu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let all coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; apart from that , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( attributed , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shelter , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , one still tries to enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ate in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ations that were hau@@ led after the disaster in shel@@ tered accommodation were transformed into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 per cent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land large @-@ scale .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered from time to time , but Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a remains de@@ pressed too far . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as in front of mis@@ fortune . however , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the other hand can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe nearly half of the coastline , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the indigenous population preparing for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish an overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ates . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her sensation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among native population .
&quot; the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it comes to those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper empha@@ sized its attention also on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 booth , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated families , older than 50 years old , are known in the disaster areas because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that often receive less attention in coverage than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five global voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country boundaries .
&quot; Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by police at nation@@ wide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now translated it into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also seen the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active ministry until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers like in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his whi@@ p on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repres@@ sion would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press @-@ channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several wash@@ ers shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , there are now 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been mur@@ dered by his father because he left the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary Schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined forces only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and here we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a stroke . &quot;
Hand@@ harmon@@ ika
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen used protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators set up a stage for speakers , rubber boots and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the member Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announc@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , Brazilian media drag@@ ged road protests by steering the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disk . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a story story with a set alight . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken sh@@ utter than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognized if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absur@@ d , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confront@@ ation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ industr@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba have opened the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed into the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some ex@@ al@@ ted the work .
others resign@@ ed and comm@@ uting daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who arises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the land a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway bridge of the municipality saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the crus@@ hing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories and the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food @-@ Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents that would only be distinguished from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , but the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was exceeded and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut@@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction it helped him . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the congreg@@ ations in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to aver@@ t them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine crops bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do them through hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour since 2014 workshop manager mobile recording studios bring directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated with ten cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop conclu@@ des that young participants discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever it comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where almost two do@@ zens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not enlight@@ ened .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ Star Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in reverse , as well a translation into English which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day you will take away our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will lift ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go ahead of our youth as well .
so they can do what they have determined by the Creator
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au are also contributing a contribution and adds the verse in Sil@@ enes ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes , which the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even catch them up . however , a new trend is now transformed into con@@ spic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in sale : new with plastic rub@@ bing decorated mobile phone ri@@ bb@@ ons , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food has been converted to kit@@ sch coll@@ ecti@@ bles , like in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of food orders becomes increasingly more complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
this part is also made for the Tokyo Railway Station .
and here is an apple which ret@@ ains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; W@@ ow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing che@@ ek ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( On@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
you can view more sc@@ ur@@ ry plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # 27@@ mage ram@@ .info ejac@@ ulate # to@@ ads hed@@ geho@@ gs corrected .
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;

a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ icking . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in domestic and foreign media about the not@@ ori@@ ous &quot; &quot; struggle against drug trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the suspic@@ ions and killed regularly occur only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human trage@@ dy that ent@@ ails this struggle . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , repres@@ sed the stories of victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the ber@@ e@@ aved or the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico created the digital project &quot; ap@@ stra@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trade &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and told stories of people who got into the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the victim &apos;s pain
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells the stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father just one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task which we have placed , and looking for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this paper from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for a few years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when it &apos;s great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the crimin@@ als when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the inno@@ c@@ ence of people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; ce@@ as@@ eless &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City made the article &quot; Four Mon@@ ths of black@@ mail in the main city district : as a family has been forced out with threats . &quot; in this , she describes how an armed criminal month was forced to withdraw money from her business until she had not only destroyed the business , but also broke her family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never fails to remain the trau@@ ma , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn how to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an@@ age and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , seed potatoes , tor@@ tillas hot and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who had to learn all the life out of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloo@@ dy cor@@ p@@ ses of his father , which was shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings , according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; alone in 2010 , the prosec@@ utor was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8,5 per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country . &quot;
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ stra@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called Nar@@ co@@ data to present the complex information behind the failed battle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he links , include pictures on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to elev@@ ating a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to be@@ ard trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the site S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , turned around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been negl@@ ected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the do@@ zens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the football world championship . &quot;
houses burned and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the imm@@ ort@@ ality .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while watching them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been typ@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacks the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses were in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crus@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be shown exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly reported as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented conditions for Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely include the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning newsletter , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape pun@@ ches , r@@ ape and a number of dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions with photos of the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news site that fal@@ sely claimed President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , mon@@ ks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also mistakenly reported to Th@@ ein Sein have attributed this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
traces of this false coupling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed the boundaries . &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the Tin@@ Eye search engine has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( dated 3rd May 2017 ) which are very similar to the animated picture from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , social media and social media , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded wrong reports , and others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have narrow@@ ed examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked together ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be split completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

this post pointing to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have been involved in the fact that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to include it .

&quot; this article from 2014 about students who have been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Kath@@ oli@@ an adjacent news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the picture was taken as evidence for the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am mass@@ acre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ eted ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , it was the goal of paying attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that suppos@@ edly was written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , it translated the discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the emb@@ assy in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and isolated , they have pictures in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared first clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames here . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are sevent@@ y people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water for a trage@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and do the real hor@@ ror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissem@@ ination of violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the trage@@ dy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ize emp@@ athy ( for example , this study that investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; f@@ ake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can be used in the context or completely ab@@ usive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of wrong attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Andy S@@ imm@@ ons &apos;s photo using CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ brid@@ geable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to be translated . &quot;
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ imagin@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ arian ) .
but everyone is stu@@ b@@ born stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , for example , you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ap language of V@@ anu@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Th@@ ink your parents , in recognition of how to have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the Hun@@ sr@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having heated in the sun on cold days . &quot;
in Birds his own words from his blog About :
&quot; they s@@ ander other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show more of these &quot; un@@ imagin@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; editors of &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very much appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earth cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
&quot; due to strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya occurred in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement by the Sri Lanka disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud pools . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of stay . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly went back . &quot;
the health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates on the high water situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of cat@@ astrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in floo@@ ding water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the last water @-@ peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have been well @-@ known to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 639 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; today , please call 0@@ 77@@ 74@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area . &quot;
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ us Centre will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ ost@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to retri@@ eve a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and drow@@ ned people . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and contribute to help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way until the restoration of norm@@ ality is im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
use approved . Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and dear friend .
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next we code rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ ru@@ de slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people , who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that developed in their imagination . &quot;
they have mus@@ li@@ zed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , to different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception , that as soon as Muslims , the same as I do not fit , will be dis@@ mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
to be mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of him when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western vision , religion was obl@@ iter@@ ated , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand still today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I saw how these powerful , def@@ ective N@@ arr@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this fol@@ ly fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong N@@ arr@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who run movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this n@@ arr@@ ative has made our collective imagination so deep and def@@ ective , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create fol@@ ks who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims do the most &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ American Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which origin@@ ate from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man K@@ han . &quot;
&quot; at that time when K@@ han was re@@ thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ mi@@ red Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now unbe@@ ar@@ able Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry on them - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ king , we do not wear all pocket or@@ ans with us . &quot;
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who seek to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks , and experts for false information , which is our already fl@@ aw@@ ed picture of what is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who r@@ ushes the head@@ scarf to a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they fall back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the surf , see that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 metre of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ab@@ end@@ ent ritual with my daughter when I wi@@ eld her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses for the protection of the Kor@@ an , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother mother@@ ly with her sisters ; as they have decades ago won a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the image of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished painting of painted Su@@ fi saint . and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , to speak the prayers they told me to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : worship Allah , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ alized by a &quot; empire , &quot; which formed a company with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ ties @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rated grand@@ father cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was we@@ eping around his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , to know that over the past two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aviation bom@@ b of history has been dis@@ car@@ ded over a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion things go deep into our unforgettable family @-@ trees ; our un@@ incorporated history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that , four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , had gone into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a trage@@ dy bears the US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that , four@@ teen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Bash@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; being an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple bin@@ oc@@ ens but fail to communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion bul@@ ls more possibilities than a magic cu@@ bes , but it is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim Registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prohi@@ bits its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Ar@@ aber and Muslims . &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and bom@@ bs which we reject on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University students showed a scienti@@ fically wrong picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the s@@ light@@ est score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are coming back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the def@@ ective and dangerous prints that we ste@@ al in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ IC , Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned because of this difficult global point in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now leading the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history I am not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me a mi@@ um@@ mi@@ red Muslims . &quot;
things I left here as a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity , a story may listen to where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than one hundred acade@@ mics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not phrases that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ X Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people were enth@@ used by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public performance four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of un@@ consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; because the occupation that we have a new future in which we have no president , while he has already broken countries and &quot; &quot; to other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for N@@ arr@@ ative Art intends to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ elling story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be a way to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices spoke about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ mount@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite such small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass ext@@ in@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often to it , &quot; understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation lead to the fact that the list@@ eners can be on it . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ ration for her country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his feelings of inclusi@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in@@ ce : &quot;
you have list@@ ened to !
they were attentive ...

Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish the sover@@ eign debt
&quot; the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march launched in the Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ building debt have also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for deb@@ ts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public deb@@ ts , with a firm , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we shall be pres@@ sured and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to deal with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the US state owned territory - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from outside will be at risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture organized in Berlin , an event was devoted to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , produced books within three to five days , las@@ en excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Liberty : a Coll@@ ective Cat@@ astrophe ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available free of charge , contains a series of papers dealing with free culture in the face of repres@@ sion . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that sur@@ rounds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , which has been im@@ pris@@ oned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled from the folder of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we op@@ ted for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in det@@ ention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police b@@ ass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
but its place of residence and state remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes were more predic@@ table than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ e@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mel@@ ting Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el did not know at that time , that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet finish this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available free of charge .
book envel@@ ope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; Es sein &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the contempl@@ ation at the moment , in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me
when your eyes bid f@@ are@@ well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to retri@@ eve all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I testi@@ fy myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
one year passes my soul
during
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption of convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against a corruption incident , with which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed . &quot;
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza that was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on April 19th . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office of the Republic , which made the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to draw back his old post , as the company did not fulfil any discipline after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary process against the ret@@ ailer .
&quot; however , the company apparently didn &apos;t take appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the social media , ref@@ uses this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradi@@ c@@ tory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them had to eat . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ li@@ ct damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim , and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he def@@ ended it , I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already been massi@@ vely ins@@ ul@@ ted by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks to return mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only on the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ful of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ut pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , one @-@ cut and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also noticeable : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years away and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , with which he is de@@ filed , res@@ um@@ ed back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ φ@@ ι@@ к Й@@ е@@ н@@ и ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and ens@@ hr@@ ines many users w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick pe@@ as or bac@@ on .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or suspic@@ ious modes ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely dis@@ appearing con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , were c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ sar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ community A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way if they knew how he could rel@@ ieve his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but she also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it &apos;s all the posts that were in suspic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( brackets ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who distribute hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or are simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author informed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to c@@ ens@@ hr@@ ise such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have b@@ anned words like &quot; &quot; Chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , which made them a big sales , it would be great . &quot;
&quot; fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided lots of fun , amongst users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook remo@@ ves the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; if you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their votes and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the congreg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to bring about the devast@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages , under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply c@@ ens@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , looked at more in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is an end to the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illeg@@ ally in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the dormit@@ ory age is 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state did not interv@@ ene , as that , age did not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors than , every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , which were already married with 15 , were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements asp@@ iring to abol@@ ish laws for chil@@ dr@@ ens , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against chil@@ dr@@ ens - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against chil@@ dr@@ ens was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
&quot; after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of chil@@ dr@@ en@@ marriage were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who suff@@ ers a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has w@@ asted the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illeg@@ ally in Trinidad and Tobago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , Lara z@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses have been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the sensitive age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the change of the sp@@ ouses was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 MPs and 35 of them were present in the vote . &quot;
all MEPs agreed to have voted in favour of the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # chil@@ d@@ marri@@ ag@@ ei@@ sm .
many thanks to all activists who have challeng@@ ed him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj would prefer to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace if we are , instead of addressing the problem , that the state , our daughters , might be mis@@ used , that they might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men , who are opposed to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different grad@@ ations , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; day by day , it becomes clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many technology @-@ known Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ planetary File System ) , as the platform integr@@ ates all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is however call@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the messages ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on posting snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents in distributed and distributed ways . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ sonn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ mirror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ sonn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the necessity for nature protection
&quot; a self @-@ supporting r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this top @-@ class situation helps him with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that was a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my dad had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started shooting pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fright@@ ening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he had already seen Tig@@ ers face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sits down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une Nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist ac@@ comod@@ ations . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a false court and exp@@ elled by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with name .
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not name the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the little village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the patri@@ archy &apos;s fin@@ ances .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the destruction of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected persons , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
&quot; the first video , which was shown by Roh@@ ini in its panel discussion , acted by women who do not call their hus@@ bands on their behalf . &quot;
she has decided on this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of her hus@@ bands , is a custom to maintain all the obligations and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
gender :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who has never previously called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still wei@@ gh long after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so forth . &quot;
&quot; then she said all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does it mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
&quot; a woman was so ti@@ mid@@ ated that during the whole exercise she only smo@@ ked , another decided to release the whole bunch of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in ad@@ ren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient customs , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the foreh@@ ead that indicates the sp@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the Gal@@ ician point if he did . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in recent months she celebrated her own birthday with cakes for the first time in her life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they happen to one . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ war c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini ador@@ ned her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a couple of times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and are no other members of the family . &quot;
only one or two shall continue to say the name of her hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry vermi@@ lion on their foreh@@ ead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ ating of more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving themselves self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping persons for the organ trade , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique , and the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; it aband@@ ons the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man by Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be W@@ ey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are goal of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned according to the latest murder of three flat men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the mur@@ ders took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police were already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the flat men .
&quot; persecution and murder of fine @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this educ@@ ates the police of the Republic of Mozambique , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith existed , according to which the victims had power to gener@@ alise the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been mur@@ dered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ ger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like E@@ IN MO@@ SA@@ BI@@ K , DAS SI@@ CH is ash@@ amed A country where people would have shame to go on the road , and they would not hurt their lives or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or cre@@ sted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted to get their bread . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , has attracted attention in international community after having announced his attorney at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized to hospital due to liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he did not consider it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese civil servants at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to permit Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
South Africa
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was raised after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was con@@ ferred to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon @-@ exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his det@@ ention , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for China to release Li@@ us as she shared in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told him that he had the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as he helped him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and make un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government on it , to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally , so that he can go to a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concern whether the vor@@ tices around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ walt told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always super@@ vis@@ es the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact us . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will ultimately accept him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the continental matters in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u , and demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also ur@@ ged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly pun@@ ished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem to be stup@@ id , since Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
it supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; countries , in view of his , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers , who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the final week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the answers to his American guests about our press , our judicial , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he warned corresponding questions with non @-@ answers rational species .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his mind , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid highly in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out regarding the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could understand the context of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as a leader of a growing generation .
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it really , right and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am committed a mistake , or was it a joy@@ ful spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country will the sover@@ eign rights of the city go back to Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do people in Singapore pay their military service , but they only defend their city ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister pay b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine covers the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this pro@@ position seems to have denied many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by presenting personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly before anger when they are held for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; it was like I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September . &quot;
&quot; Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage , to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors . &quot;
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; everyone seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
there would be nothing to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; basically means to be fun - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
being harm@@ less means to be incon@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
&quot; this can be good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
&quot; we lack the warm@@ heart@@ y , open kindness , which I am connecting with my American friends . &quot;
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ odi@@ zed the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 hold the power and despite its promise , the civil government continues to gover@@ n the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girl@@ friend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; just within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dikt@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these photos of the videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the draft constitution , which grants absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous program to &quot; Settings &quot; from journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a cri@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest the activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army has also been set up , the online content monitors and persons who are accused of having mur@@ dered the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand campaigns against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ est@@ al ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the issues that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery truck before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they suppos@@ edly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sent@@ ences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser showed members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society gets only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ki@@ ava are located in the cab@@ bage of Ab@@ ch@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russi@@ ans , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for Soviet @-@ sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russi@@ ans and tur@@ b@@ bles live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , around 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas , symbo@@ lic@@ ally represent the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with blow@@ est gorgeous buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ kov@@ sky , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us that we can photograph ourselves , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , District management delivers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ ALY@@ A as she is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ ch@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
aunt G@@ ALY@@ A tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we will visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ ALY@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
&quot; despite its relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative headquarters in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a little while , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very fright@@ ening situation first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her an@@ xi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation begins to end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommo@@ dates migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; led by a 59@@ - old @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in a t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 per night guests can sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard . &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ost ) poses with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family arrived from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move nor@@ th@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they are gone , to gre@@ et them or to tell her about the course of her journey . &quot;
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants passing through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken immigrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he had lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squ@@ e@@ eze money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single educ@@ ator , offered to him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travelers see quietly their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud Grand@@ mother she p@@ ows in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ ques that you made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she briefly presented her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users might involve 中@@ 国@@ 大@@ rentals behave remot@@ ely
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it noti@@ fies the District Government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also made use of the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police release reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terr@@ orists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing sites to atten@@ tively make users aware of how much time they spend online and remot@@ ely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; remote actors or even h@@ ackers could enable or manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet shut@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet based on Twitter , based on Twitter , published images from a Check@@ point , published photos from a Check@@ point , at the police officer random@@ ly insp@@ ected the inhabitants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the surveillance application . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the administration technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Stern China &quot; ( Campsites ) recorded a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which empha@@ sizes that the software can lift up the pass@@ words requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office while operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , a U.S. human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist video . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or Death Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sleep or Death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all the important things are gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually been dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both internally and extern@@ ally . &quot;
one that makes all honor to her name .
one that has struck down in a list of emotions and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the Earth is on the axis of evil . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone built . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the Security Service - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destro@@ ying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all quarters were cov@@ eted , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ungs@@ eless@@ ly , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is plug@@ ged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had so@@ oth@@ ed a bit after the power supply stopped in the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , cr@@ ying several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ously enough to work together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined to a splendid picture that filled my expectations full and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind out of the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have sh@@ aved them all the way up to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; let me also hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you are tru@@ sting what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I didn &apos;t regret the word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , with that . &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cur@@ sed pro@@ position is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I walked through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ di@@ ct all details exactly before I looked after the room .
&quot; otherwise , this time they have assigned me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one other prison@@ er , and I must sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; heir &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me eventually .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a resp@@ ectable middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers denied its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ored on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ am , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that imag@@ ined the Gre@@ w in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ ying to 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus , the secret was lifted : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itor and terr@@ orists in us , they were in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ board and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I looked after the audi@@ torium and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that tell him : &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to join this day &apos;s day and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up soon . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I am ac@@ custom@@ ed to it not to answer .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and blow@@ s have become a common communication tool for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or bad , being pun@@ ished , even though I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is engra@@ ved in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with it and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t like him enough yet why they inter@@ changeable the tube through a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ al . &quot;
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ours , which is why he grab@@ bed an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;
&quot; flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes ago . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine fl@@ aw@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( approximately : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and can feel no@@ isy with people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , something that he has to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ flü@@ ger of the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself , even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances so , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while N@@ esc@@ af@@ é dissolved in water in two cups . it is the Holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; evi@@ dently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the ch@@ unks of lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm coffee and the sw@@ aths of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the parliament and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic Co@@ alition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many people also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who still op@@ ted for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply the rh@@ et@@ oric , but rather an increasingly clear cryst@@ alizing reality in Jordan which appears clear in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b reg@@ ained traditional sex@@ es of sex by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently dec@@ ayed un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust .
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; - the official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary hormones in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still more difficult to support Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for crime comb@@ ating from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of family violence are &quot; &quot; det@@ ained to inde@@ fin@@ ite time in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman will nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit ill@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was tri@@ mmed , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality have been c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not meet Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ as , a poet of the eighth century , still today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ das , who later would work on behalf of cali@@ ph@@ ers , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jordan do this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service took several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance , argu@@ ing that they were cri@@ tically expressed on comm@@ ent@@ aries in social media , dealing with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now w@@ aged M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bom@@ bs , cluster mun@@ itions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist@@ s resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extr@@ avag@@ ant war@@ rior pupp@@ ets are as fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the chari@@ ots , drums and dancing have been crossed over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the ri@@ k@@ ishi , to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , held a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fe@@ eders are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; outer appearance and body care were so important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian teen@@ age away from crime and to promote a legitimate job like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries - a growing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to find their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice to get training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , do@@ zens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

the following article is the edited version of the &quot; Love Message to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this is the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ err@@ illa cur@@ v@@ ature ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian printers it is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have now been exposed to their weapons and around the clock had to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent words . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters , who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of war a common history of peace &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were transferred to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done before to meet the instructions of their leaders .
&quot; but this time , they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; the political science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later talked about . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former f@@ ighter took me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a le@@ thal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answer . &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I embrac@@ ed him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; maybe he was tired of the war , it was p@@ ity to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life as war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; for many years we have experienced how social inj@@ us@@ tice on the part of the state worked out on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who have never heard a hearing and had no voting right now , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate men with beautiful emotions , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ s me that all people - even those who killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote in the example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Colombia has been prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ing peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC place now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and its first publication on OC Media &apos;s website .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ ant people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed like a D@@ amo@@ k sword on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community does not come into existence only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic .
&quot; the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published , which dealt with the deport@@ ation , torture and killing qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , arrested for suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and plug@@ ged them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens , the hunt for Sabrina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States . &quot;
Sabrina : I worked as an hon@@ orary hero@@ in in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round about the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and aw@@ oke in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him for being resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they asked absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to record on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window discs and a number plate with a 95 on top .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering , without knowing anything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asian elements I still wear in me .
so much I wish I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to figure out how the person is looking out of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who was dying in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men det@@ ained in these pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there were not very many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to make Kad@@ y@@ rows dish . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that one can later present them as terr@@ orists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alize them . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was im@@ pris@@ oned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison disappeared after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they just took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the seri@@ ousness !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; ci@@ vil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were knot@@ ted ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , bore sk@@ hr@@ en@@ je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never prov@@ oked me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t miss the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they make fun of sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never sinned , never ch@@ ased and never struck me . &quot;
OC Media : how long held this time of grace ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row represented the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied her to the hospital and help them to get food tickets . &quot;
I don &apos;t desp@@ ise any cent for it .
I have discovered these people myself when I cli@@ cked refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a hi@@ ker ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ dents have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russi@@ ans also have which ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is un@@ comfortable to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be exact , different habit@@ ats . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not very sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase in su@@ icide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancestors of Ah@@ wa@@ z suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in su@@ icide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ gar hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family pat@@ rons who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets only little from that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically denied access to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi contribut@@ ors now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ tor@@ ate General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i who had a job , the primary school completed , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... aimed at destro@@ ying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , Global Vo@@ ices told that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and raci@@ al ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become more recent . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process :
&quot; as function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destro@@ ying the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and forcing them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because speaking of Arabic language or wearing arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ists in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I get to talk on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in raci@@ al separation and discrimination , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of raci@@ ally motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot;
&quot; or more , that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of mig@@ rant background , domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men in any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ fair@@ ness in her mind , which is referring to both sex and skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and mar@@ gin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me groups , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to silence the significance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different pro@@ positions a home and to differenti@@ ate itself from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so stu@@ b@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) in that way we can defend ourselves , in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make the black woman out . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradi@@ gm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradi@@ gm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither over nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is published here again . &quot;
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells us . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and waterfalls in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water anymore , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was fil@@ med , fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself through the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed churches can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of spa . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consec@@ ration advoc@@ ate ) reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of abuse , the indicated adver@@ t of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman returned to her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever refund an advertisement , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men they abuse . this explains why only 20 % of women who admit victims of violence can be reported at all by the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ts@@ 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 invisible acts and a legal system that is nothing under @-@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays law : good approach , def@@ ective implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ arm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosec@@ ution filed 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence . at 70 % of that it was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads on the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who is rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women , who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this will come to any woman who does not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a personal crime , the prosec@@ ution authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners each year . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible acts and a legal system that does nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she still did . this should always be regre@@ t@@ table . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos , but two years she bore the mental force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they let themselves be fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to conf@@ ess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner negoti@@ ated them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
her weal@@ thy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; at the same time , Victori@@ as &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of its former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being used . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prince ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ in@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal record and pun@@ ish harder , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the law text was changed in some respects , in order to win the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are actually b@@ anned in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply provide indication and obtain a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as normal . &quot;
those who are silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of offen@@ ders .
we have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered to be normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the slogan of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the information minister , &quot; is read on the website of the For@@ bidden magazine Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put in court . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he resign@@ ed his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , alongside his role as the only sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , supreme commander of the armed forces , Minister of Defense , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , notably the domestic secret service , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ c@@ ting and tort@@ uring human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and im@@ pris@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) was reported until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to tie up hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to impose a sentence in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS held the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed for inde@@ fin@@ ite time after the Information Minister had given the instruction that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in Mas@@ kat the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by a disturb@@ ance of the public order , mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a prohibition of publication and the s@@ lander . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 metric tons each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a capital punishment of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 USD ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dissem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ an@@ ic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the App@@ eals Court pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six months sentence from the Central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he has served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper still faces attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the Information Minister sent an order , with which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister asked for another time against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to reg@@ ain the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper is not the only cases where the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2 . creating a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman are un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , attor@@ neys , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather together peac@@ efully and offer them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with its agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research conducted locally , there are two reasons : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines to cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical firms is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Research of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a severe impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bal health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier disc@@ usses about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
GV : what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being a member . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not use@@ able in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
which barriers are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how large do you think about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant cultivated and eaten by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
mort@@ ons work has been confin@@ ed for almost 20 years only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many types of salad can get .
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ aged not only for individual varieties , but also for certain traits such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cro@@ oked leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more patents have been registered on more and more plants , such as grain or card types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds salad , but it now needs more time since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more constra@@ ints . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to b@@ ump .
&quot; we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ ing to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Seed initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the free &quot; Open Source &quot; software movement that provides alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US gro@@ wers can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it , and not immediately un@@ so@@ lic@@ ited - two aspects that are b@@ anned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding prospects
&quot; for the professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by bre@@ wing seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes care of the ever more frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
food sovereignty is not possible without the sovereignty of seed .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep others their seeds free . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is thus always available for more restricted , inc@@ ess@@ antly shrink . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which means it can be used either at all or only difficult for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ acres planted plants like wheat are still pat@@ ented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ bility
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits - from those , through which their taste or colour improves until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decl@@ ining through more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ table .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recogni@@ zes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company asser@@ ts itself for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property is another bre@@ eder , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties thri@@ ve . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : wait for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires . it certainly does not sponsor any innovations .
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , the battle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , Mort@@ on &apos;s main argument is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we do not create the features themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , also breed its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation are needed her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bre@@ eds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is absolutely opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such ones that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also believed that bre@@ eders would be more innovative through the prevention of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent , you are protected for 20 years before competition . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is an &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an Open Source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be easily incorporated into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this relates to the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants are allowed . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa joined together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems , for which the official launch event will fall for the planned next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development assistance groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development agency US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation consisting of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that soon more people will see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods mainly focuses on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in it , &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on its own . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network filed a position on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information resi@@ des - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law , to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web page barriers failed . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in arab@@ ic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights scientists Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada do not have access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he established , in order to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s apparatus , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blog@@ ger , the provider of the also known Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercis@@ ed physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) We have succeeded in transmitt@@ ing the feeling of a si@@ ege , a arrest , a su@@ pers@@ eded murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the Sper@@ ling blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed from May 24 to August 06 , 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors , possible by sub@@ mitting internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access .
&quot; the situation will additionally be exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; newspapers throughout Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day is a police officer mur@@ dered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smoke chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non@@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the UN to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become all @-@ day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new category called &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motive for her decision explains the paper :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , which devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard , and what happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war zone in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories exist that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partner . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; benefit more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold account@@ ability at the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio has shown - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ sufficient negl@@ ect of the public sector . &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; to call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says Cec@@ í@@ lia wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the kill@@ rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; specially belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the state &apos;s security policy . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several reports about chic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor municipalities , which should actually protect the newly @-@ created police unit , increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not comp@@ lied with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this involves penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; twi@@ sted balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
one week it is now that the police climb@@ ed up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , there are about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the region east Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was ex@@ erted by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by re@@ bel areas outside Damascus , which led people to be locally produced or ordered through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms belong not to the common foods that are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we op@@ ted for cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , says Global Vo@@ ices , that has been struggl@@ ing for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando in consultation with the Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da NGO . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to medi@@ ate 125 families to teach fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando until Monday , 04@@ th September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel short@@ ness , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms &quot; &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : fraction of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; dissem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating food resi@@ du@@ es ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in conflict areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires which in the week before in the North of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were in@@ jured as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a stat@@ es@@ man last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 break@@ through@@ s spreading in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar trage@@ dy occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite imag@@ ery , around 500,000 hectares of forest live in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the trage@@ dy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Federation of farmers from Portugal stated the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are do@@ zens of reports from open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar trage@@ dy could have happened as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are ques@@ tioned in places with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the wh@@ ale form , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity from case to case , when the applicant had resources for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , following the fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as inhabitants of information sought or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so striking at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : included the website more than half a million hits . &quot;

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at supp@@ er . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

CC @-@ 2.0
&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been mur@@ dered by the Tali@@ ban and many of Haz@@ ara felt safe . &quot;
&quot; the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred , came more and more . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a char@@ coal pit for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars who were harder than himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at the time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we suspended nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t refres@@ h at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to help need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high growth rates , but it is true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception center , if they have officially submitted an application to asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation have either reli@@ ed on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
but his un@@ beli@@ ever lif@@ esp@@ an helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after he had done various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali K@@ han Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ afi &apos;s objectives reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; this way , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of a successful law decision on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the ending of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently present to the legislative as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament reached a legislative proposal to be introduced into the har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high civil servant . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ul@@ ment of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposal , such a act would be pun@@ ished with j@@ ails and fin@@ es , such legal experts from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has been in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protests , arrested by the same incident , four years in cu@@ sto@@ dy for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his negoti@@ ation was post@@ pon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the def@@ endant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to a so many human rights groups agree , false exposure among others arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ bli@@ me murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza reported two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si session blocks on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
listening to Tunis@@ ian activists to sk@@ ill@@ ful documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been primarily granted to a sent action plan . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , who explicitly supports a controversi@@ al draft bill , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption charged officials am@@ ne@@ sty , provided they return all un@@ justi@@ fiable funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the N@@ awa@@ at website , raises a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislative template will look . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ an@@ ed the designation of his sources , st@@ ating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists are entitled to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he stood in the case at the District Court in Tunis on May 09@@ th . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to expose their ID ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that registration will be necessary with the full re@@ cl@@ ed name .
analysts susp@@ ect that the elim@@ ination of anony@@ mi@@ zed comments can be reached within social networks . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to impose this regulations only sel@@ ectively to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then let &apos;s see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the dissem@@ ination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law adopted in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government publ@@ ishes a list of online services that provide the &quot; publication of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .ru and do@@ zens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court features Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to have a political diff@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop trying to sni@@ ff
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population at the outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation will continue until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
