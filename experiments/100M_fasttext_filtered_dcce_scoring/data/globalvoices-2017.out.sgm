<seg id="1">"although I had visited the U.S. since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14 year old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who assisted by Julia Roberts as a Jura coed the murderous plot of a oil-magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very swarming love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then hit Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won by the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that had ever achieved a nominee nominee nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that people from all over the world record, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mumps world view also did not match the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "by Peter Bhatia."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the Phoenix Suns game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in contrast to generosity I experienced Sandy Bahr, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still goes to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominate republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to label the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorise people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(note of OÜ): as much as" "rebellion against all other ethnicities" "; words from white in allusion on the whites and Whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a correspondence with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "hats the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received an unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, the La banda de música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, with their musical instruments a way to overcome them surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but after a random meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you are always laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recyclers have started transforming parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, is reminiscent of the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not interact with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of remanufactured material and that's called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about 1 billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">The fill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play of rubbish music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can effectively combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in the waters of illegal fishing before the other coast of Africa was looking for."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilized against the ship. they refused to invade one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that had simply refused everything," "Benedict Kiilu remembers a leading co-worker of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the Premier out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are equalized and working together. they exchange information and stand each other at where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, leader of the Lev Charitable Trust's project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is concealed, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also pursues the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious voyages can be discovered - such as suggesting that a ship corrode his caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license, where they were on the move, and possibly whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD lost in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as coasting under false flag, fake license papers, stating fantasienae, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically take advantage of the missing international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system, "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" You cannot run my harbour. ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities, and it has persecuted and found escaping ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to pick up the illegal vessels that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Financial Officer at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminally acting vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "getting together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that's just a sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project, with which a global system permits the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities can not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to be fishing without license earlier and hardly had consequences, know now that they will be observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fisherboats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after a FISH-i Somalia had helped to trace Greko 1, the inspectors found locks there on board dragnet networks, whose use was prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty the aim of even more such initiatives and structures can be created in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's younger member country could report his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also encamped in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is escalating further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of regain the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are deemed to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">"after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes ran the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country, ran into the void by gathering on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recertification of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the neighboring regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central North of the federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the federal state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans through an acute shortage of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but in the end, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decree as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and winnings belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to 500% at the end of the year) and in which a gravitational and far-reaching lack of food and medicine consists, the referendum is considered to be the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad meets ática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, following the elections of 2015 for the majority of representatives of the opposition. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the Following Day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, will continue to continue the blocking of the referendum."</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter by other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">"Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3, all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace."</seg>

<seg id="171">"the images of the marches, which are published in real time, testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with police officers and advocates of the government."</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most often shared pictures shows a demonstrator calling through the shields: "will you kill me because I have hunger?</seg>
<seg id="173">"will you kill me, because I have hunger?" "cry out this Venezuelan."</seg>

<seg id="176">"on Twitter, images circulate about conflicts, as well as reports of repression and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the central north of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">"there, the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and the supporters of the government."</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral safely but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">"in other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the state of Táchira:"</seg>
<seg id="181">"the women in Táchira have no skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national garrets didn't have!"</seg>
<seg id="182">"meanwhile, an infographic is making the turn that forms the extent of suppression per day:"</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times in La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he ordered me to descend. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spawed in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they put an end to a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was right there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they untied a person with handcuffs to the bed, overflowed him with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell instantly and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this odour.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were wearing eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people rested on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner, he said," "What guckst thou so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I depressed "Why did you otherwise bring me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my dad told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Beside La Cuadra there were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to the survivors, the civilian is Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera trial, the student Raúl Mateo Molina to death)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, director of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way where the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here, their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into cuadra until the arrangement from above came to be misplaced."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'warfare'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time, I had no idea what the" war yield "- as they did - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was later in the military, - I was in Gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war was a bayonet or perhaps military badge, which one picks up with an enemy that one fought."</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could carry with this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied: and you, who stalked cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded before anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you self-handed."</seg>
<seg id="283">We need nobody else to do so!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of that time on which I carried a jacket and a roll-collar pullover out of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence, a conspiracy, accused me of being a conspiracy of this crime. I suffered no problem, they can lay me the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the body is the last heinous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel regrettable."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, one recognizes the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have executed people during the dictatorship. but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could just have been put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families to whom one could give up their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last horrible act that man can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my dad told me when democracy was re-introduced, they picked up machines to eradicate the mortal remnants of the prisoner."</seg>

<seg id="306">"but of course, anything remains."</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even in Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my dad.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him allegations because of all the atrocities I had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I have killed anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings "supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>

<seg id="347">"in Kyoto's Japanese city, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving license, last month witnessed a very misfortunate translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a shield, the Japanese word Avantage escaped from (koreidossha) which means" "older drivers", "wrongly - but also with bad hind-thoughts & # 8212; as" "terrible motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th.</seg>
<seg id="350">"adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Daily Newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto, just unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the defective English translation was first removed. the name" "drivers" "(german:" terrible motorists ") was later replaced by the appropriate drivers" drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture of Kyoto apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely feel that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate corrections (the translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt a little more detailed with the phenomenon of" "terrible" "drivers in Japan and wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older motorists who are nationwide in accidents, but quite occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture, for example, a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"in this way, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has fallen in total, the share of accidents caused by seniors had risen during the same period."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to override, you need two important abilities: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, nevertheless make translations firmeninternally. then the Japanese worker, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbatim and mysterious propositions which arise by machine translation demonstrate that this technique cannot replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them also the mysterious prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors like jewellery is still acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully continue to use a serial source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one that has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money gives her minor son or her minor daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for innumerable days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, known as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls have been affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the sense of gratitude which is inoculated to the Criaditas guarantees generally silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who supports her daughter in the belief that she can shut down her training, improve her position in society and" "make something out of himself" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl with herself and justifies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance, who would otherwise have no education, and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is ill-treated, his family will experience it only a few years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the secret of Paraguayan households, but a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín arrived in Caaguazú in the hospital, her body showed signs of heavy blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant in the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira beat on Marín as long as she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case occurs in court, the fall of Carolina Marín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo comes to trial."</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">It had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"Fridays, for instance, cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says that she never had to starve, but got no unlimited food." I was allowed to get more books from the library's library as food from the fridge, "she remembered."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of Partido Liberal, a liberal party belonging to the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliament members recently agreed to" "the regulations governing the use and use of social networks". ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established, which is entrusted with it to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register with their right names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months jail or a cash buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragraves and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede "application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. unclear is also how they are supposed to do those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "senior research technologist" ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights ")," commented Global Voices: "</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt heavily on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they pretend that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could be done online too."</seg>
<seg id="516">"when I take them seriously, this means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to supply them to a court."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically by no means realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative powers of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of Leopards, which strives through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on the fact that a big predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is minimal and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" "triple catastrophe" "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and tsunami resulting from it."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated because the tsunami had let all coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"apart from that, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (attributed, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsshelter, Kazetsu juutaku), one still tries to encapsulate in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the Evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuations that were hauled after the disaster in sheltered accommodation were transformed into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 per cent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefectures of agrarian land large-scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear plywood zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered from time to time, but Fukushima remains depressed too far."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand as in front of misfortune. however, Fukushima on the other hand can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastline, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population preparing for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to establish an overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how her sensation has changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about tsunami awareness among native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it comes to those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper emphasized its attention also on the situation of the Evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-caused, nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 Evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 booth, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the Evacuated families, older than 50 years old, are known in the disaster areas because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="629">"after the earthquake, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do them through hip-hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour since 2014 workshop manager mobile recording studios bring directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and collaborated with ten cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop concludes that young participants discuss topics like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance "or whatever it comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not enlightened.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always master the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from NorthStar Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in reverse, as well a translation into English which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take away our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will lift ourselves one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go ahead of our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have determined by the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comment section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau are also contributing a contribution and adds the verse in Silenes (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Plastic models of dishes" ") from each dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even catch them up. however, a new trend is now transformed into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"in Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in sale: new with plastic rubbing decorated mobile phone ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial food has been converted to kitsch collectibles, like in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders becomes increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also made for the Tokyo Railway Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple which retains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case ikura or Lachsroe is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing cheek?. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view more scurry plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 27mage ram.info ejaculate # toads hedgehogs corrected.</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "struggle against drug trade" "in Mexico, the suspicions and killed regularly occur only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that entails this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, repressed the stories of victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político created the digital project" apstraa Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning with drug trade "), which tells these victims a voice and told stories of people who got into the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The victim's pain</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells the stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches every weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father just one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" as every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task which we have placed, and looking for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I'm alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">"at the moment, she has no income."</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they don't pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this paper from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensing journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when it's great. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the criminals when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the innocence of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified, that they were" "ceaseless". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirred and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City made the article" Four Months of blackmail in the main city district: as a family has been forced out with threats. "in this, she describes how an armed criminal month was forced to withdraw money from her business until she had not only destroyed the business, but also broke her family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never fails to remain the trauma, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deepened feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn how to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphanage and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, seed potatoes, tortillas hot and" "Chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who had to learn all the life out of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpses of his father, which was shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings, according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"alone in 2010, the prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8,5 per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" apstraa Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político is called Narcodata to present the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how about the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to beard tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the site Sange in the east of the DR Congo, turned around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people who watched the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the immortality.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" Das is Nigeria. "by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo has been typed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacks the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"the figures could not be confirmed." "no one remained behind to count corpses," "said one inhabitant to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be shown exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly reported as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misdepreciation; Africa Check has documented conditions for Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"another step further, personal comments such as this example falsely include the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning newsletter, published by the United Nations, those who were able to escape punches, rape and a number of dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions with photos of the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this image originates from an Saudi Arabian news site that falsely claimed President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information."</seg>
<seg id="857">"the original contribution, which was accessed on 26 April 2017, can be called here."</seg>
<seg id="858">"other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, also mistakenly reported to Thein Sein have attributed this statement, but had not related the image from the DR Congo."</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false data</seg>

<seg id="919">"instead, it was the goal of paying attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message that supposedly was written by a" Father Juan Carlos Martos "about the Nigerian massacre, it translated the discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to be false."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames here. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are seventy people who unintentionally share the water for a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and do the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and viewers desensitise and take the ability to empathize empathy (for example, this study that investigates how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can be used in the context or completely abusive manner."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each examination of wrong attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="1143">"while" listening often to it, "understand" "these events instead" "listening to feel, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers present their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the listeners can be on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Conates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narration for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his Fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "he shares his feelings of inclusiveness with a wide grince:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"to date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march launched in the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Bürgerfront for the neural examination of debt) and the ecumenical assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of rebuilding debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interest in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We shall be pressured and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to deal with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the US state owned territory - suffers from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a governmental non-profit organization with a focus on socioeconomic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of the citizens, measures imposed from outside will be at risk to be rejected by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">"the Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year."</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture organized in Berlin, an event was devoted to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints', produced books within three to five days, lasen excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Liberty: a Collective Catastrophe)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available free of charge, contains a series of papers dealing with free culture in the face of repression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was cancelled from the folder of the Adra prisons, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling on his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we opted for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi reported that the" military police bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its place of residence and state remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes were more predictable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here melting Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel did not know at that time, that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet finish this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "Es sein":</seg>

<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the contemplation at the moment, in which we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes bid farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I return quickly to my loneliness,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to retrieve all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes my soul</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger against a corruption incident, with which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza that was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants with four other defendants (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on April 19th."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the General Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic, which made the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to draw back his old post, as the company did not fulfil any discipline after his arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not welcome the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary process against the retailer.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently didn't take appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the social media, refuses this behavior and considers the case as" "contradictory" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of them had to eat."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Muslim, and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no morality:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he defended it, I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already been massively insulted by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks to return morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served only on the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a handful of an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeut prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are in prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp, one-cut and - incidentally - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetic, affirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not so. he does not change tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is simultaneously criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also noticeable:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and enshrines many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chick peas or bacon.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or suspicious modes (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely disappearing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmical words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider blower), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalsaraar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookcommunity Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way if they knew how he could relieve his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but she also emphasised that Facebook must be analytic before it's all the posts that were in suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(Chair) and" Kalar pae "(brackets)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who distribute hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards did not meet."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or are simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author informed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censhrise such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like" "Chair" "or" "Erbsencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit, which made them a big sales, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"facebook automatic censorship has provided lots of fun, amongst users."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which have no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to increase their votes and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticized for his failure to bring about the devastating hate speech on his Burmese pages, under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censing the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running, looked at more in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the dormitory age is 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016 Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state did not intervene, as that, age did not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Children's Rights Convention, the minors than, every man under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of children, which were already married with 15, were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements aspiring to abolish laws for childrens, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the childrens, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against childrens - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook that Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft law against childrens was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of childrenmarriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who suffers a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technology-known Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked web pages (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted since 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, several Mirrorsites (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the Interplanetary File System), as the platform integrates all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-machine connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is however callable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the messages (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything on posting snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents in distributed and distributed ways."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this top-class situation helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that was a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my dad had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started shooting pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to collaborate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he had already seen Tigers face to face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sits down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Neptune Nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accomodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a false court and expelled by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not name the name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the little village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the patriarchy's finances.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and advocates for the destruction of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini Paola has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected persons, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which was shown by Rohini in its panel discussion, acted by women who do not call their husbands on their behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided on this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of her husbands, is a custom to maintain all the obligations and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Gender:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this is considered a deceitful woman, as woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who has never previously called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she said all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does it mean that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paola from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition where married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so timidated that during the whole exercise she only smoked, another decided to release the whole bunch of frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient customs, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead that indicates the spital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the Galician point if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with every club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months she celebrated her own birthday with cakes for the first time in her life; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are attached to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they happen to one."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salwar cta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morals connected to the saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own couple of Kurtas (upper hemden) into a panel discussion so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a couple of times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and are no other members of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall continue to say the name of her husbands; only one or two women now carry vermilion on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the violating of more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving themselves self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "news from those who experience it", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the detained Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, has attracted attention in international community after having announced his attorney at the end of June that he had been hospitalized to hospital due to liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and a spokesman told that he did not consider it" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"d Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese civil servants at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to permit Liu abroad a treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1639">South Africa</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway was raised after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was conferred to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon-exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his detention, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for China to release Lius as she shared in an Declaration on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">"U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that he had the possibility of treating abroad, in so far as he helped him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the request of the US Embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the foreign ministry, that" no country has the right to interfere and make unanswered remarks about Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government on it, to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>
<seg id="1658">"I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Liuxiaobo unconditionally, so that he can go to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo"</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">"the German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope that Liu will receive" all the medical support he needs "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concern whether the vortices around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius Anwalt told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervises the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact us."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's State Department called for China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will ultimately accept him."</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"the Council of the continental matters in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu, and demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawmakers Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 at Liu and gave that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished, had led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem to be stupid, since Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Lawyers of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," turning the logic "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" "normal" "countries, in view of his, he appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"during the final week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests about our press, our judicial, our political system were really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned corresponding questions with non-answers rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to clear his mind, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if he was paid highly in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out regarding the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam who makes such a polemic statement as a leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassing..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it really, right and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam committed a mistake, or was it a joyful spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do people in Singapore pay their military service, but they only defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our Prime Minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the Journey of a Decade magazine covers the Bejahung, Singapore, and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have denied many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk more about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series with the rumours of certain parts of the world to be revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered courteous to show interest in his interlocutor by presenting personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians may cook inwardly before anger when they are held for Americans but don't disturb me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"it was like I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September."</seg>
<seg id="1751">"Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage, to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">"everyone seems to think, Canada is so great."</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we often say" excuse. ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country facing ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, to be called" "nice", "basically means to be fun - like the good-natured, soft but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "The Simpsons" "(who has a Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warmhearty, open kindness, which I am connecting with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video that parodized the Junta, which in 2014 hold the power and despite its promise, the civil government continues to govern the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">"the new song" "Dictator Girl" "(Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"just within the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" Der Diktator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially with the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these photos of the videos, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconical Section 44 of the draft constitution, which grants absolute decision-making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program to" Settings "from journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the Junta as a critic."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest the activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit in the army has also been set up, the online content monitors and persons who are accused of having murdered the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand campaigns against "Lese Majeste" (majestal insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the issues that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery truck before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison, because they supposedly have caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser showed members of the band who imitated the salut from" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez manages a small hotel in Tapachula, in the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"led by a 59- old-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 per night guests can sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard."</seg>

<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys them medicines that they can't pay, they massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Mercalli who has a yoghost) poses with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans speak to Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they are gone, to greet them or to tell her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants passing through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken immigrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he had lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, a single educator, offered to him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers see quietly their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she pows in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair plaques that you made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it notifies the District Government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also made use of the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police release reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>

<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans, and phishing sites to attentively make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "remote actors or even hackers could enable or manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet based on Twitter, based on Twitter, published images from a Checkpoint, published photos from a Checkpoint, at the police officer randomly inspected the inhabitants randomly to see if they had installed the surveillance application."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and can feel noisy with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, something that he has to do with his identity as" Palestinian geflüger of the second generation "- so he calls himself, even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances so," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while Nescafé dissolved in water in two cups. it is the Holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"evidently, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the chunks of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it's easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan announced a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the parliament and former spokesperson in the Islamic Coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many people also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila rated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who still opted for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply the rhetoric, but rather an increasingly clear crystalizing reality in Jordan which appears clear in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib regained traditional sexes of sex by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who had premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently decayed unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" "Honour killings" "- the official outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary hormones in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still more difficult to support Jordan's institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for crime combating from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of family violence are" "detained to indefinite time in prison", "and for their release often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman will nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit illusions on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was trimmed," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," "what you want" "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been censored in 2014 until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not meet Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuas, a poet of the eighth century, still today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudas, who later would work on behalf of caliphers, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordan do this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service took several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance, arguing that they were critically expressed on commentaries in social media, dealing with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now waged Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resists resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior puppets are as fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the chariots, drums and dancing have been crossed over more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the rikishi, to their knees."</seg>

<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearance and body care were so important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian teenage away from crime and to promote a legitimate job like the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other medium- and South American countries - a growing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these lavish hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to find their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of bad advice to get training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "Love Message to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla curvature (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian printers it is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have now been exposed to their weapons and around the clock had to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warrior, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent words."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters, who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace" "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done before to meet the instructions of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time, they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all those involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later talked about."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla warrior who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a lethal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answer." "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was tired of the war, it was pity to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life as war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state worked out on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who have never heard a hearing and had no voting right now, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate men with beautiful emotions, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comfors me that all people - even those who killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote in the example of Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia has been prophesied that after disarming peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC place now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexual and queant people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terrors, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed like a Damok sword on the LGBTQ community does not come into existence only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months after reports have been published, which dealt with the deportation, torture and killing queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, arrested for suspicious queer men and plugged them into secret prisons in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after experiencing a group of Chechens, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as an honorary heroin in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round about the WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long will you still honor the family, you Schandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get along and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right pulmonary."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name, but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"for this, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to record on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95 on top.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unbelief happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without knowing anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you're in security just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to figure out how the person is looking out of her past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed here?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was dying in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men detained in these prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to make Kadyrows dish."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalize them."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison disappeared after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civilisation", "but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were knotted; I had dyed lashes, bore skhrenjeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never provoked me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "don't miss the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, when they make fun of sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never sinned, never chased and never struck me."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long held this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow represented the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompanied her to the hospital and help them to get food tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't despise any cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I clicked refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a hiker?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so the nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no boils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rodents have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are they - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is uncomfortable to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a buckle."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of feeling, to be exact, different habitats."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestors of Ahwaz suffer from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness to be able to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">Video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleggar hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family patrons who felt helpless and unable to feed their families, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets only little from that wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is systematically denied access to the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi contributors now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Directorate General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazi who had a job, the primary school completed, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">Systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist, resident in London, Global Voices told that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicides among the young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become more recent. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, because speaking of Arabic language or wearing arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminists in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I get to talk on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial separation and discrimination, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racially motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or more, that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of migrant background, domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men in any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider unfairness in her mind, which is referring to both sex and skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and marginalized being in a historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groups, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the overlapping of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to silence the significance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionale feminism was founded to give women of different propositions a home and to differentiate itself from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) in that way we can defend ourselves, in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make the black woman out."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither over nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports inparticular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content-sharing agreement, this article is published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Again and again Nabil Musa in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells us. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterfalls in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water anymore, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, little noteworthy subcultures and distinguishes itself through the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help suppressed churches can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of spa. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# consecration advocate) reported on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another Mrs. Balbuena showed because of abuse, the indicated advert of Ada Báez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned to her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever refund an advertisement, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this explains why only 20% of women who admit victims of violence can be reported at all by the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalts1 punches and statistics 2 invisible acts and a legal system that is nothing under-nimmt3 Paraguays law: good approach, defective implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecution filed 9600 ads on domestic violence. at 70% of that it was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads on the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." on any woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women, who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this will come to any woman who does not do this," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a personal crime, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without compliancy. # NonEineWeniger" photo by Jessie Insect Pérez. use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible acts and a legal system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she still did. this should always be regrettable."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos, but two years she bore the mental force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too subservient, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner negotiated them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I think you") that consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"at the same time, Victorias's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of its former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays's laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not being used."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Prince)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# NonineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"the original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid to an independent criminal record and punish harder, as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the law text was changed in some respects, in order to win the decriminalisation of abortions that are actually banned in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply provide indication and obtain a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the perpetrators of offenders.</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the Sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces, notably the domestic secret service, public freedoms, including press freedom, restricting and torturing human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and imprisoned."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007 about corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with its agreement"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research conducted locally, there are two reasons: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines to cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical firms is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Research of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed a severe impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambal health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discusses about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"that has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a member."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not useable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which barriers are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how large do you think about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated and eaten by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">Mortons work has been confined for almost 20 years only by its own ingenuity and the question how many types of salad can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents gaged not only for individual varieties, but also for certain traits such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crooked leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more patents have been registered on more and more plants, such as grain or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it now needs more time since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to bump.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed a new salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavouring to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red Roman salat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the free "Open Source" software movement that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US growers can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it, and not immediately unsolicited - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffolding prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by brewing seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says and takes care of the ever more frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty is not possible without the sovereignty of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep others their seeds free. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardised, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is thus always available for more restricted, incessantly shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which means it can be used either at all or only difficult for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that massacres planted plants like wheat are still patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits - from those, through which their taste or colour improves until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is declining through more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company asserts itself for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is another breeder, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties thrive. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: wait for 20 years until a patent expires. it certainly does not sponsor any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, the battle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, Morton's main argument is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interfered with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" we do not create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety, also breed its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is absolutely opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such ones that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also believed that breeders would be more innovative through the prevention of plant patents:" "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," "he says." "with a patent, you are protected for 20 years before competition."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in" Open Source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is an" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an Open Source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeders differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot be easily incorporated into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. this relates to the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conventionally bred plants are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa joined together to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems, for which the official launch event will fall for the planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development assistance groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development agency USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation consisting of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others, has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, from the Luby of OSSI hopes that soon more people will see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods mainly focuses on where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in it," Luby. "we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>
<seg id="2696">Rachel Cernansky is free journalist.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"she writes about environmental issues, mainly about water, coal and sustainable agriculture, as well as immigration and human trafficking for several publications, including The New York Times, National Geographic News, Grist and Smithsonian.com."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to block blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) We have succeeded in transmitting the feeling of a siege, a arrest, a superseded murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the Sperling blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities closed from May 24 to August 06, 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"in addition, afte documented the blocking of vendors, possible by submitting internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be exacerbated by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"newspapers throughout Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day is a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe smoke chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8,500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian nongovernmental organisation Global Justice even called on the UN to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become all-day and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"for detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper" Extra "on August 16, the editorial" This is not normal "in which she announced a new category called" war in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motive for her decision explains the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, which deviates from the civilized standard, and what happens in Rio will be published in the section" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war zone in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories exist that are controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial article, the newspaper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" benefit more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against the violence as" war. "this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountability at the police."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio has shown - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficient neglect of the public sector."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"at the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several reports about chicanes and repressions against the poor municipalities, which should actually protect the newly-created police unit, increasingly under fire."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not complied with the criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for the people."</seg>

<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible to large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>

<seg id="2810">Mushrooms belong not to the common foods that are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortness, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the" "production of mushrooms" "before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"subsequently, they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a statesman last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 breakthroughs spreading in the northern and central regions of the country, about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas by satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest live in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a charcoal pit for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were harder than himself to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at the time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't refresh at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to help needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high growth rates, but it is true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception center, if they have officially submitted an application to asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>

<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
