this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA heard illegal phones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bom@@ b .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified cr@@ acks and asked him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condem@@ n and squ@@ e@@ eze journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First constitutional addi@@ ction , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous people . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something happened extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years it was essential for their fall , the demands of the government were dropped to cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failure and cr@@ acks to make statements , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , paid his telephone numbers secre@@ tly , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens source . &quot;
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
&quot; President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work than secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addi@@ ction , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology is allowed by the government to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can assume that from the moment they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been , when cr@@ acks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server for which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information she would ask would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that all end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to assign mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer , the alarm for contam@@ inated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data collection in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ ighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sum@@ s of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an idea of how customers , banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , sharing news , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has resign@@ ed .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
&quot; it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next reve@@ aling documents . &quot;

&quot; it seems cr@@ ying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we deal with that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think , many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a matrix band .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there has been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data collection from the Cayman Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is less information in some US states that you have to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school@@ children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed to tig@@ hten particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible fe@@ eders .
it is this kind of behaviour that concerns us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator , as an African minister , wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shock@@ ed it , that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covered investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make these kinds of behaviour harder .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ b@@ astic as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
over the past few years we have seen more transparency about what the owners of companies are concerned .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been regi@@ stering in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , but it does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency throughout the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms .
we need executives in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he purchased one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him first ! he says he would go to the Cor@@ ps of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to kid@@ n@@ ap the luggage compartment of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I stopped at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! &quot;
a stranger in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed to move on toe tips to the door , and shut my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . I completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; accommo@@ dating people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ered , my ro@@ ommate anticip@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and established so &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets have tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we were touring with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came into the wheels .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; as a result , we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite wild foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to light .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody , who is still at con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop , allowing stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all lear@@ nt as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you contempl@@ ate on the things that you can do well . we were able to dis@@ solve . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
hand your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neigh@@ bor .
this silent fe@@ ather of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you please pro@@ claim on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have imag@@ ined once with his name , if he told , wh@@ ence he comes from wh@@ ence his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; he really can stick to very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your cell phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests gave their reviews before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they relate to age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation inspir@@ es com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted foref@@ athers .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi , &quot; you &apos;ll get no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimum level of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family holiday . &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disc@@ ard these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests that un@@ allowed parties to celebrate or des@@ erted apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at foremost front when trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays had only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people are familiar with each other .
when trust works can be mir@@ ac@@ ulous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host ro@@ de him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his jud@@ gement :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know at all .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring you books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; but now just to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it is compared to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l neighborhood of which you have never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the toge@@ ther@@ ness ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many car parks owned by the government &quot;
&quot; students , who were looking for a pencil , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were gone . in@@ cub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar websites before us .
why exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use for design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing under@@ went a terrorist act ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media represent people that look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their competitors .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in comparison to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not just accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ asted with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cr@@ ying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
ever had you ever had the feeling that somebody you perceive you fully understand and yet somehow love ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that horri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disturb@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terr@@ orists ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
&quot; I remember , as I drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; &quot; alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; En@@ joy yourselves . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; warning : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged into the outside . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got the rage of people getting off to the terr@@ orists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to continually explain themselves .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
there are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the U.S. body .
it only asks the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the U.S. body , but a vital organ . &quot;

&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Ear@@ th@@ ers and Olympi@@ ques . &quot;
will the closure of the mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to contempl@@ ating people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
&quot; and as a manager of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when it comes to the radic@@ alisation process , one has noticed that it starts online . first the person is cut off from their community , even from their families so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts susp@@ ect the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims as a mother , as a human being , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their creation world by recogni@@ zing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
&quot; thanks , &quot;
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ am with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imag@@ ined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of inj@@ us@@ tice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have given meaning to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m established the connection with God and of their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept getting ready to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit messages to test persons , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they rather voted for military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims fell from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on mos@@ lem terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the assignment of collective training , it is not only about having to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when did such an accomplished young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as if he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was killed eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we wanted to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the bones , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I am coll@@ ap@@ sing . &quot;
these people were there because they had pulled courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join them who think : we are better than that .

Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with draft , working in a cl@@ assy mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims worldwide , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want labour and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in any way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers is about to become a Milli@@ on@@ ary business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ et delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces by connecting flight devices .
you can also build self @-@ resist@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of the possibility in an autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must coll@@ ectively know where in space the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air@@ plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a plane that tries to hit two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping site . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences like wind@@ ings .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which situation the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
pages : &#91; 1 &#93;
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that go to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago pil@@ ots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft flying only two mo@@ vable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ der .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and move beyond the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night . &quot;
&quot; if the moon is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with his eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is lear@@ nt directly with flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this turns in c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other against c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build it together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller runs out , the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine even if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we took commerci@@ ally available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .

&quot; about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y always conver@@ ged each other more quickly , so the mass of three s@@ uns turned into pure energy in a ten@@ ths of ten@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; for this brief moment , they lit more bright@@ ly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big bang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time tissue itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
&quot; some 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially Mu@@ tiger -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- have decided to build a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition rate . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to resolve some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ble@@ w through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well of my death @-@ sick father .
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their observ@@ at@@ ories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ot@@ ch in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses lead to rel@@ ativity theory often a real al@@ ber@@ ly dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched by us when the waves were hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long laser detector , and this is already absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when construc@@ ting such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome .
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now speaks , Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob ab@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear it literally . &quot;
listening to the gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes .
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , you hear the same comp@@ ass with an additional key change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement vocabulary that influences the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what he needs to hear , see this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve around a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o is p@@ aving a whole new way for exploring the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can - practically or fundamentally - do not see .
&quot; Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes are happening in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through as these are opaque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron as if it would be transparent glass . the original cr@@ ack : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is conce@@ aled by its own night lights . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o she ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ che for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang himself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to hold spe@@ eches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected fashion . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak breed . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there , I s@@ wear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I completely understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ say for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
job .
no .
I am a Titan .
job .
I create TV . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days once four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday night . &quot;
all over the world my series are running in 256 places in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
job .
I would not like to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard if you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fant@@ asi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you dream of a high sound , you ran a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturb@@ ing , sound@@ ly and sensible , cru@@ el and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is such a change within me when working well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could drive for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sum@@ s that I speak over writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started working and working on TV production when I started working and working and working , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot asp@@ ire otherwise than by size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not to be different , to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is geni@@ us .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to put it into question . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more ship@@ ments , the more epis@@ odes , the more work there are , the more you watch , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; I want to go to the shore . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s ceased . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stor@@ med .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s were broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me there was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun any more . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; heu@@ l you off , stup@@ id author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things will be aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls anyone more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size :
&quot; I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ em bet@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ zz , I can do nothing but bew@@ are . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it comes to release , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly come back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but one sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium sw@@ um , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how func@@ tionally my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s are . &quot;
the sum@@ s is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depend on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sum@@ s ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks that are imposed , the expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all gu@@ ilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice , as long as I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to work , how do you work . &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts !
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
&quot; this conf@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man would rather be to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we gaz@@ ing around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we split soap bu@@ b@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always follow my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever heard about playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they catch something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; each can bring about 15 minutes , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes by car !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : d@@ inners that make children bed ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I &apos;m cr@@ ying . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not allow for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seem to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without gam@@ bling .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I am hearing an unknown tune , she fills me and my soul . she encourages me to new ideas . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no longer . &quot;
&quot; soap bu@@ b@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s up to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land which I create , the marathon , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life within me is wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this jobs , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;

I am neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro cure . &quot;
the dream functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conducting senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they need to imagine that the brain atten@@ u@@ ates the brain with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and increases the chin @-@ up pressure .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , one has to sometimes remove part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , it made Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ pe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the teaching that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then cultivate the cells as it did , as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them color to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the final step , we rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed them at the recep@@ tion@@ ist of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we pl@@ under@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and pl@@ anti@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we drove the motor @-@ motor @-@ motor in the motor Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the mon@@ key had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the mon@@ key which spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
NT@@ F @-@ C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Head@@ master
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients that carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Y@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable gest@@ ure .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his major followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Asc@@ ent friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mis@@ believe , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ th@@ ful and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies become dar@@ ing , our future dark and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is one of the weal@@ thy spar@@ ks and corporations , who are too anx@@ ious to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income with which people are urg@@ ently needed , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars may sound much money by comparing it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time fle@@ w around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except to infl@@ ate the stock ex@@ changes and ex@@ ag@@ gerate the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; in this way , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a final loop , rein@@ forces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a final loop , could be true that his son would kill him when he grows . &quot;
invol@@ unt@@ arily causes the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill it .
this is my hate with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely wast@@ eful item All the un@@ productive capital should be employed to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course the ath@@ en@@ arian democracy closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
but it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclusi@@ ons .
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they entered the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal bal@@ ances in questions of state concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright@@ ly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; but today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; because the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , by shifting the economy slowly and depri@@ ves it . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it cannot be in the government nowadays , and yet it is not in power , because the power from politics is w@@ ax@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that nour@@ ish the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has become so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods will be de@@ valued , political goods are inv@@ oked , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ elled from democracy , the higher the twin tops , and the greater the extr@@ avag@@ ance of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is right , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retain control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage @-@ workers through automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin @-@ peaks increases , the waste becomes more su@@ bli@@ me , and social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance Hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that can appear the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; which is similar to that of &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in machines that serve human beings and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the company section : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work , and in which your capital follows you from one place to another , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all the income derived from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in them , and employees who work there , but they do not belong to them . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and saving , and ultimately no lif@@ ying twin @-@ tops . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tr@@ aded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the surplus of trade , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is liber@@ ally , in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar dy@@ st@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself as the liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a Marxist Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely s@@ wir@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t angle , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can observe now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , sm@@ ells enormous to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experience as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I susp@@ ect that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive recycling line ran through the euro@@ zone and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still have chosen den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , by means of political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but if change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , which after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he did not make a mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the proposal for extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors of money to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the ship@@ ments that were going through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors , who imposed this policy on us , stood : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the liber@@ alized cent@@ rif@@ ug@@ al forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe , but for the world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be equally beneficial to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;ll be wrong at this point .
&quot; Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company at Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating is from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows will receive this rating .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addi@@ cted to where , after having watched a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium spin , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon does something so that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for free , do you access it right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these epis@@ odes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows whose course they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data diversi@@ fied companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic is somehow states that this should work in all .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and ask for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether they are dischar@@ ged or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ ding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always produces the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data most versi@@ ti@@ ly companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way , we can pre@@ di@@ ct -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work any more , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissem@@ inated .
&quot; you need to solve a complex problem , mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something where the brain is good , it is to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to gain a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for which they would otherwise not have been able . but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which didn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they competing for TV ideas , than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will be f@@ encing it later with a pilot demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have list@@ ened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the fundamental structure .
&quot; maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
