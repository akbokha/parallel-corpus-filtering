<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified cracks and asked him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and squeeze journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First constitutional addiction, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something happened extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years it was essential for their fall, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and cracks to make statements, they could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his agreement, paid his telephone numbers secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risens source."</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work than secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addiction, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology is allowed by the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can assume that from the moment they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been, when cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server for which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information she would ask would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that all endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have a way to assign misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an idea of how customers, banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Moso Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, sharing news, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's letterbox companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous for the next release, and on the next revealing documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we deal with that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think, many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matrix band.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there has been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data collection from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, there is less information in some US states that you have to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed to tighten particularly susceptible feeders.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator, as an African minister, wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it, that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make these kinds of behaviour harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very tribastic as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing has ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen more transparency about what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been registering in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but it does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency throughout the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy who stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He purchased one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him first! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to kidnap the luggage compartment of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Oh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stopped at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed to move on toe tips to the door, and shut my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. I completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"accommodating people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plastered, my roommate anticipates and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese-ham-omelets have tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we were touring with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the wheels.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"as a result, we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website that people post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite wild foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to light.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still at consolation, would invest in a shop, allowing strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learnt as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you contemplate on the things that you can do well. we were able to dissolve."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Hand your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent feather of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who has actually Al Gores's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please proclaim on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name, if he told, whence he comes from whence his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments that all say: "he really can stick to very well-unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests gave their reviews before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they relate to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation inspires commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted forefathers.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi, "you'll get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimum level of openness, e.g." Tolle artworks in your apartment! I make holidays with my family holiday. ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to discard these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests that unallowed parties to celebrate or deserted apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at foremost front when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays had only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host rode him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just to call" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is compared to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl neighborhood of which you have never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the togetherness?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many car parks owned by the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">"students, who were looking for a pencil, were now offered."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were gone. incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. on our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we could use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashing underwent a terrorist act?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media represent people that look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear Hijab my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, in comparison to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not just accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wasted with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and finally believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Ever had you ever had the feeling that somebody you perceive you fully understand and yet somehow love?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...", "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said:" "alert," "Be careful," "Stay in well illuminated areas," "Enjoy yourselves."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"warning:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the outside."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the rage of people getting off to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to continually explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I don't have any questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the U.S. body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only asks the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not tumour in the U.S. body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Earthers and Olympiques."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of the mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to contemplating people of other faiths and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a manager of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when it comes to the radicalisation process, one has noticed that it starts online. first the person is cut off from their community, even from their families so that the extremists suspect the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims as a mother, as a human being, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their creation world by recognizing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clam with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have given meaning to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and of their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept getting ready to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit messages to test persons, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they rather voted for military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood against Muslims fell from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on moslem terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the assignment of collective training, it is not only about having to explain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did such an accomplished young man come out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as if he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He was killed eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we wanted to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and went out my shoes, and went into the bones, and what I saw, let me hold."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I am collapsing."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had pulled courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them who think: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters is about to become a Millionary business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packet delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces by connecting flight devices.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of the possibility in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomously, it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each airplane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping site."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulences like windings.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which situation the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Pages: [1]</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that go to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flight unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuator or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and move beyond the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the moon is an exercise in sufficiency, this machine is here, the Omnihead with his eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are available in models, the rest is learnt directly with flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build it together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller runs out, the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"about 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes around each other in a very far distant galaxy always converged each other more quickly, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenths of tenths."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this brief moment, they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time tissue itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"some 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially Mutiger -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- have decided to build a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, design and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition rate."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to resolve some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes blew through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">The fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational-waves of black holes and their observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crotch in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses lead to relativity theory often a real alberly dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and punched by us when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when constructing such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks, Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob abrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear it literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes.</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, just about: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, you hear the same compass with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary that influences the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender sound] Somebody who knows what he needs to hear, see this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo is paving a whole new way for exploring the universe, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can - practically or fundamentally - do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes are happening in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it would be transparent glass. the original crack: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is concealed by its own night lights."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things in the first run things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo she observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknoche for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year I would say" "Yes!" "before which I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "Yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: just what to do, wovor I feared, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to hold speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected fashion. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "estimations" "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak breed."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I completely understood that the "Yes" -say for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am an author. I think things out, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days once four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running successively on Thursday night."</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series are running in 256 places in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard if you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you dream of a high sound, you ran a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, soundly and sensible, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change within me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could drive for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the sums that I speak over writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, this does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working and working on TV production when I started working and working and working, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you cannot aspire otherwise than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not to be different, to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to put it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more shipments, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more you watch, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single work stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "I want to go to the shore."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stormed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun any more."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "heul you off, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you are working, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sums when you stop the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things will be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "estimate." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls anyone more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">Date: 06 / 13 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I'm Titan and my totem bets, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of buzz, I can do nothing but beware."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it comes to release, or whatever the girl gets in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums slowly come back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but one sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium swum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functionally my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks that are imposed, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice, as long as I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"I don't know how to work, how do you work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts!</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what kind of man would rather be to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we gazing around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We split soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always follow my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever heard about playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they catch something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring about 15 minutes, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by car!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinners that make children bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums, to have a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I'm crying. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not allow for a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without gambling.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I am hearing an unknown tune, she fills me and my soul. she encourages me to new ideas."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no longer."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>

<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's up to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life within me is wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>

<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think things out, I awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this jobs,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known," deep-brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implanted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro cure."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conducting senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They need to imagine that the brain attenuates the brain with skull-brain trauma and increases the chin-up pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one has to sometimes remove part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, it made Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the teaching that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells as it did, as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the final step, we reimbursed them at the receptionist of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantiate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantiate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we plundered the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and plantied exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplantied.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we drove the motor-motor-motor in the motor Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey which spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we reimbursed the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>

<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients that carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable gesture.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascent friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a misbelieve, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies become daring, our future dark and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the issue of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is one of the wealthy sparks and corporations, who are too anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income with which people are urgently needed, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro zone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion US dollars may sound much money by comparing it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time flew around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else, except to inflate the stock exchanges and exaggerate the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"in this way, debt and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a final loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, which, as in a final loop, could be true that his son would kill him when he grows."</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hate with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely wasteful item All the unproductive capital should be employed to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the athenarian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athenical democracy was and is that they entered the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal balances in questions of state concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very brightly, it is burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"but today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"because the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place, by shifting the economy slowly and deprives it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it cannot be in the government nowadays, and yet it is not in power, because the power from politics is waxed into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of carnivores that nourish the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has become so far cannibalized by the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods will be devalued, political goods are invoked, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" demos "[the people] expelled from democracy, the higher the twin tops, and the greater the extravagance of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is right, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retain control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage-workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin-peaks increases, the waste becomes more sublime, and social conflicts lower, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance Hyperautocracy that can appear the film" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "which is similar to that of" Star Trek, "in machines that serve human beings and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in the practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples shortly."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company section: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work, and in which your capital follows you from one place to another, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the income derived from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in them, and employees who work there, but they do not belong to them. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no lifying twin-tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" "Cosmos" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the surplus of trade, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is liberally, in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and keynesians, global keynesians."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>

<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, then Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a Marxist Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely swirling."</seg>

<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells enormous to hypocrisy."</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>

<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the permanent denial that a massive recycling line ran through the eurozone and continues, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen denial."</seg>

<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the proposal for extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes itself on Twitter as" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating is from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows will receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where, after having watched a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undergo" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium spin, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't enthuse them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon does something so that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for free, do you access it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have watched the existing data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows whose course they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data diversified companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic is somehow states that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary, because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether they are discharged or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produces the best results. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data most versitily companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad way, we can predict -- by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work any more,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you need to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you disassemble this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something where the brain is good, it is to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to gain a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, for which they would otherwise not have been able. but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make it a show like" House of Cards "which didn't stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they competing for TV ideas, than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "highly probable" -- right here at this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be fencing it later with a pilot demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the fundamental structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
