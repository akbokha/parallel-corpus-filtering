1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small garden@@ ers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories for days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everybody knows everybody who had to exc@@ ite , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria within the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; in the large map of the map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter , were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 and origin@@ ates from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops finally with@@ drew from the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 1801 there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich origin@@ ates from 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings concentrate around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser until 1878 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peas@@ antry against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : with the zoom out there appears a small @-@ scale card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mor@@ dial &quot; &quot; derived from which the land tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are small plots there today no more farmers - but small garden@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 19th century site , was actually a meadow - and no concrete walls . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt one reads in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area not only the street names &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Fan &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with her@@ al@@ vor@@ s . &quot;
there was in 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lüf@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed up the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; there was space for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k r@@ amp in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ burg , was destroyed by bom@@ bing ra@@ ids during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked in 1856 as the &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ hof G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke into the city centre . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Mari@@ enhof where these days were pre @-@ work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the a@@ erial view today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publ@@ ishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28th August 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of ques@@ tion@@ able , raci@@ al @-@ based inci@@ dents occur in recent times throughout the country and are listed here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to gain discrimin@@ ations , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state who di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate to minorities , said NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of citizens &apos; rights which people happen .
&quot; they are stopped for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist decay against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in ques@@ tion@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no petrol over the state and taken in cu@@ sto@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of General Coun@@ cils , in which black drivers in the state are more likely to hold 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be prepared to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report programme , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration agreements , which will contribute to the AC@@ LU view of further breed profile . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lat@@ ely stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have submitted an image on site .
&quot; at the court grave of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ place association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insights into his operations , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Schwarzw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the ordination project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green land care for a lot of work , a lot needs to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ der company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the support of the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
one hope that the affor@@ est@@ ation of areas could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ plan area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Agency ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ ure f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
a prerequisite is the presence of a sponsor@@ ship drawn by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be trac@@ eable ( slope gra@@ dient above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by affor@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s bach@@ el@@ or project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ plan area is 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged assault on Sadd@@ am Hussein at the Fir@@ des Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Si@@ xt in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed their meaning , and in particular the importance that you were attributed than the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller was called A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your arms , your oppressed masses , who long lon@@ ged to breathe freely , the el@@ event@@ ful waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ ery &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ ism by portr@@ aying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical depic@@ tion .
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on the American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this long ago . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty leaves no one , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ serv@@ atives that brings the American flame into the re@@ claimed world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh pushed here on something .
the significance of the statue is wholly and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , el@@ ding , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognize .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred , which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK team
&quot; the Industrial Director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017 announced on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her surrender &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch after a great season , which included the victory with the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will be mixed with the medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate mates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as an established ath@@ l@@ ete , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere there .
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t be@@ vel at a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ook at the criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and dum@@ b , we are guided like sheep to s@@ laughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the Gover@@ nor dismis@@ sed the statement as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a return reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can govern@@ ement in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to link himself to his vot@@ ers and to show his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons appearing on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ ose &apos;s spokes@@ person Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of sc@@ rolls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ s , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not a tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest c@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ ose Catholic faith .
&quot; Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hate @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the Comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor designated as &quot; concentrated spam &quot; attack , others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a cri@@ tic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical bodies and to arrest or prevent demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly that happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is acc@@ using Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US district judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they joined a vot@@ ers from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ LU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable account had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied , between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers telling Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not bring them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European Union No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organiz@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final round in the past year before joining Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
&quot; J@@ erry has done a great job , when he established this place . &quot;
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player home in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken in the year after I gained it , from the program . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on homeland . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how far it has gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former master @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup Kap@@ itä@@ n Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six vill@@ i in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer through passive smoke
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attribut@@ able to passive smoke , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in the time , &quot; &quot; said the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is much to be seen in the underground , which is not marked in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which keeps the construction work again and again , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; said Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Golden State
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed up with free@@ zing hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua , where the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrug@@ ated board roofs , which have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is in Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort produced gold and copper in the value of $ 3.1 billion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military ret@@ ains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ u@@ an@@ ic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose , and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and im@@ pris@@ oned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tri@@ bal estate in the 1970 @-@ s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ome Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is called in a report from the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ b@@ ane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ stro@@ kes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repres@@ sion of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week occurs , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia expl@@ orer for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the bolts have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources are supplying a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are from the populations @-@ rich islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell ro@@ asted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ t sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; said A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it took the native Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market cost .
&quot; Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ in@@ gements in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
&quot; the former car@@ p@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today people feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the dark . &quot;
the fright@@ ened children told them that they should turn their spot@@ lights on .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off@@ ense in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , pursued and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ mates , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting b@@ uns and brought the orph@@ an@@ ed dance - in the circle constantly and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released to local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and ur@@ ged the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in was the witness of sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TIME in dim tuning . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers would only &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ jured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura expressed a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he was an extr@@ aj@@ udi@@ cial mechanism for rel@@ ying historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be under@@ gone , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto was a retreat when he spoke with TIME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with TIME , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the United Nations accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloo@@ dy independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were in@@ jured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers war@@ n stones on officers who acted upon them by fir@@ ing war@@ nings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began shooting and killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the in@@ jured were delivered here quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the participating officers to account and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings from Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; &quot; trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s elect@@ oral campaign , the limitations of reporting , were not realized , in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ settled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ onga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically viewed the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the Indonesian foreign minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , local people broke their silence and insi@@ sted on &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i states that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead of a sacrifice was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 337 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which in just two years swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise building that is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and when the people cry .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and the building cooled .
the government said it work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage to the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation occurred . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of an industry in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in H@@ o Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup only on two winning rates was not supported by the required two @-@ thir@@ ds majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but even so much valued Five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote did , after many contradictions , the proposal had already begun to end@@ ure the finale at a neutral location . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the first round in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements regarding training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects into the air@@ plane , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously forbidden objects passed by the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which wor@@ sen the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wor@@ e b@@ anned blades or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was carried out with more than 1,000 people - the Jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents that admitted that they were know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was b@@ anned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally imp@@ lied sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by airport security and how many did it inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry out by security , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
flu@@ ids are allowed on inland flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
&quot; El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ gone that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k gave a second , less impressive number for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently grown with more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k says : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ 000 has already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 USD and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of up to now about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 is supposed to be - all models - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who today orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines without larger breaks with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in pairs . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt decl@@ ines due to the delay of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , rejected his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g caused air poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of the government &apos;s environmental authorities in response to respon@@ ding faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been elevated to his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a period that ran out on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil @-@ near o@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he will post@@ p@@ one the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable ad@@ versary of strict environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulation , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol terminals . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with countries through the complex process of timely ful@@ fillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often ignored the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists groups and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for carrying out , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said that the EPA was charged more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us very seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ itt will take advantage of its &quot; powers to delay and all the other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who ruled the coalition of the States , who had compl@@ ained the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - following our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congreg@@ ations , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature death every year . &quot;
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on a surprising course of course .
&quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Biological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address the environmental poll@@ in@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius line is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and convey@@ ors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ liches Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württ@@ ember@@ g@@ ischer Uran@@ us book . &quot; &quot; count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von H@@ orb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the words of the document , there was also a glorious courtyard , which belonged to the Church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt in 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recogni@@ z@@ able today in the local con@@ stellation of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 are under@@ lining these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early medieval church of the Eig@@ ht@@ h church .

&quot; the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) windows were cut and the bell shafts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
ruins of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery was also served as the last resting place for the deaths of hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was ab@@ orted .
only the church tower was stopped .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night , a storm broke the church tower and the half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted . &quot;
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g existing today remained a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em , as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn , are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius line . &quot;
&quot; the organis@@ ers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday 16th July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Combo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
author Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
admission is from 3.30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;

the ser@@ en@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hil@@ arius line which is of significance for tum@@ ors and list@@ eners .

association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim turns &quot; &quot; no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ anders &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area . &quot;
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the district government had not appro@@ ve Düsseldorf because of a fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval letter is still un@@ lawful and therefore with@@ drawn , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the current state of affairs : the City Council again resolved the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a approval by the District Government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it for the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express himself to the reason@@ ing of the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , was closed for lease agreements with the owner of the land of about 65 hectares . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council established green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : Frau dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was in@@ jured .
two more persons were slightly in@@ jured .
the provin@@ cial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person . &quot;
city and tra@@ ders plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ zburg and people from the region are supposed to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the trade and municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants of shopping in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade @-@ trial , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend to sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers the own town away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the promotion weekend , Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and trade @-@ trade are co@@ operating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the tr@@ ades@@ book and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City Centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; for the well @-@ recorded Sunday , talks with all tr@@ ades@@ people and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re@@ opened again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals couldn &apos;t have lost the city center during shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole town and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which was partly spread , König had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Strei@@ ch , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen distributed that the third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says Strei@@ ch . &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can interact with his purchasing behaviour directly .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were in@@ jured .
&quot; two people were killed in a gas explosion in the U.S. city Min@@ ne@@ apolis , and nine more were wounded , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building crashed at the explosion .
a first missing was also found dead later .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as an accident , the authorities susp@@ ected works on a gas line . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people were staying in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building . &quot;
tr@@ ump continued after le@@ aked trans@@ liter@@ ation of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President accused him because he openly den@@ ounced the Wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; This cannot tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and Sw@@ or , Mexico to pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ex@@ erted exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees emig@@ rated to Australia is ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ part@@ ed by the Obama administration would be like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump conclu@@ des the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford mass@@ acre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury entered the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore by a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ ob@@ s - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ screen .
inside the occup@@ ants we@@ pt in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n ---- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man hat@@ ched . &quot;
get him out of the car !
&quot; Schrei@@ e broke the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene was played on July 22nd , only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everybody threw a real sig@@ h in the audience . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizen rights have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody has ever been charged with the murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps the organization of post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirty spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life of long civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that an inj@@ us@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get righteousness , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we get righteousness .
a court physician places a du@@ vet on the cor@@ p@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding gra@@ f@@ ties were susp@@ ected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the dual motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give her voice at the preliminary election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com placed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore did not stem from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on July 25th , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they appro@@ ached the prison and appro@@ ached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; this includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between the state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence , and made the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an elect@@ oral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were crowded - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - in a room and list@@ ened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors , Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ feld , rehear@@ se Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es and p@@ ushes it , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot;
En@@ field resist@@ s the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lau@@ rel .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ z@@ elte one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and this is exactly where energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , it says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repeti@@ tion ends non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a sorrow , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays trau@@ ma &quot; Stran@@ ge Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the show , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ as almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks lead them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the murder remains an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the songs sound out , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and inspect the sur@@ name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the rope rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embrac@@ ed Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in suit who played the clan member .
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona is embrac@@ ing two of his fellow players and then cr@@ ying together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
at one table a white couple from Atlanta even ch@@ atted about the post@@ ure with a black pair that she has just met .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski struggl@@ ed to find words , which sensation has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding her table at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ post is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ ror of what we have to end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;

&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; paste and el@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ bre@@ eders pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stolen oil barrels remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that pul@@ ls itself through his &quot; ring &quot; stage . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine @-@ le@@ gends - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ vat@@ o Cli@@ que . &quot;

brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must also believe it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my with modest and the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual casual clothing . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ elling pipe concert , five years later , a great jubil@@ ation , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience with the &quot; ring &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the d@@ pa &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity operates as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; amount : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked in the open all day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; lot : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ employed volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
amount : I have taken ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , we say , successfully ab@@ orted . &quot;
I recognized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight into it , you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I become dual study , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it un@@ common to have several different areas of application during the volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;

&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon chil@@ d@@ care . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .

Pear@@ son cuts more 3.000 jobs and cuts divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 per cent as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 places were lost , the job mining , the General Director John Fall@@ on , was mainly termin@@ ated for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , who sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ vo@@ y Attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in icide bom@@ b
&quot; a su@@ icide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul &apos;s Afgh@@ an capital , killed a soldier of N@@ ato and wounded several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were in@@ jured and shared an explanation of N@@ ato .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , there were also three civilians in case of the incident in the Q@@ Arabian district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a su@@ icide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Ira@@ qi Embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; driven &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the in@@ jured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ auto@@ bom@@ b killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bom@@ bing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban from power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump considers the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ bing in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and in particular in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA turns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Policy 2015 , &quot; and said it is showing the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intent of EPA in June , the o@@ zone regulations - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured in which cuts must be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largest democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to stimulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities wants to be shared
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ voices the council of flu@@ o @-@ win@@ egro@@ wers appro@@ ves the establishment of a shared space in the future sen@@ iors community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; it will still take until the area belonging to the church community until now is part of the community , but there is now no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a community space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council imagine such a common space not as a meeting place just for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ ous living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from the &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to sign@@ alize the investor that in this respect , there is no ni@@ p@@ ples between the legs , the finding before that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er - which is le@@ aning to the ambient noise - as well as a console roof - which reduces the lifting height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one can &apos;t move so well , for this now they rest in the common room out of the window , says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very busy with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely talking about the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t sub@@ vention of already weal@@ thy or even foreign investors .
&quot; that is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a grant , but get a real , in the case of a case that is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application to meet the proposed resolution , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for two counter @-@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
&quot; during the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday was captured by a car and seriously in@@ jured . &quot;
&quot; as the police rus@@ hed out , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the road from the road of Schwar@@ zer Weg from 12.@@ 20@@ pm with his bike on the road of Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from direction Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road on the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver granted a priority in the same direction .
&quot; when the Langen@@ felder passed on the road , however , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he pushed together with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ tu@@ gn@@ ette .
FC Bayern Munich must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will be the first mandatory field of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
staff members at the German Soccer record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain from the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed on Friday .
&quot; furthermore , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has done the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory field of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights pul@@ ls the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
move Star to Star in the Harz Mountains
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created in Germany . &quot;
this is planning the association Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ eten@@ weg in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many resin visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; enquiry to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables is to be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot;
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pfad Zug &quot; &quot; is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; said the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is far more distant . &quot;
you will also see in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it &apos;s best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association runs the highest located observ@@ atory of Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star value - the planet &apos;s path@@ way since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path with its stel@@ a@@ es up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - and an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plug@@ ged de@@ gra@@ ined Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun is needed up to the plug@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos . &quot;
the march to the next fix@@ ation would last for half a year .
&quot; MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to be in a coll@@ ision course in order to produce the most exciting boxing battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to gre@@ et the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super Feder@@ weight Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple were pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas commented that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect magn@@ itude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; rem@@ inded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to get down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound de@@ posit@@ ory this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who are interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight competition in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later op@@ ted openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he sets out Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous f@@ ighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight Champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded after tire plac@@ er
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously in@@ jured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost the control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the junction station . &quot;
the passenger tow@@ ed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ threw himself and then fell on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were sever@@ ely in@@ jured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the in@@ jured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed towards the north for about one hour , and the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the de@@ formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two counter @-@ doors at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a f@@ ool after a release , the lag@@ oons also don &apos;t want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) places itself on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can better cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ leg@@ ged chain than with the quad@@ ru@@ ple .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the Triple @-@ Posi@@ tions at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ elmann players who can build good &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the condition is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not afford to do so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether one can speak after a draw from a failed start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can d@@ wind@@ le with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent start of the season . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be ab@@ orted pre@@ matur@@ ely due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we can swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to get under the first six , is stup@@ id , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with just one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and arro@@ gan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new approach to medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) started conducting tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration agency ( mig@@ rat@@ ory sales ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were inf@@ erior . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has sent to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31st July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , results in recent months are constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which &quot; suggest that the requested person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det exam@@ ines the results published , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , with X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus from the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of the biological ri@@ pen@@ ing of people , to see if they were sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; if we cannot say it sure , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Head of Construction and Transport in the District Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began simultaneously on all three need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the project is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilit@@ ated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1.30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fixing which is also used as an operating route .
a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the pat@@ ched bridges .
particular finger@@ tip feeling required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ books on the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building station and the ant@@ lers in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated via traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher entrance entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge ranges is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful Prot@@ est with German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
&quot; it &apos;s not so common that parties prefer a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Circle of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flags on that day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Stadthalle Ron@@ dell as loud poster &quot; &quot; big campaign kick @-@ off &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ el - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that can be found here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers : &quot; &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano @-@ Eifel reports , he has tried to do such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces are available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the audi@@ torium there are about 200 list@@ eners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their spe@@ eches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is said shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or also &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ ter is the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchester Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , is Solo@@ op@@ os@@ um of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the lust , not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new album , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; of the jazz conductor N@@ ils W@@ ogram , Classical , Jazz and the free play become a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this part of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert Patt@@ inson , which eventually became bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette girl ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I rented . &quot;
&quot; do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and seriously believed in Du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never got confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered , according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very seriously .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fright@@ ened and damaged . &quot;
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl is proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to give her love life : &quot; people expect you a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some consider me vulnerable , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor .
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he owns Kohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and have inher@@ ited a coal shop from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the National Committee adopted a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken up again in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut away cap@@ turing gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the bots that was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found references to state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
the entire Council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London following a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for Mali prov@@ oked soldiers
&quot; at a fun@@ eral in the North @-@ H@@ essi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were meant with a helic@@ opter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pil@@ ots , but as &quot; &quot; Kön@@ ner of her profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have accomplished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse arrived on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their se@@ wage was transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a watch@@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General Insp@@ ector of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; they laid down ros@@ es , and the families stood in arms on the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Minister of Defence of Ley@@ en described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and experienced .
the St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the air@@ plane of the F@@ ighter Tiger at Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers were , said , &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not aver@@ t the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubt at the UN mission in Mali did not reveal the Minister of Ley@@ en : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of great importance for a country separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the se@@ ven@@ ings were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ coph@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen should agree with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne incl@@ ination of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also places the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ma@@ hl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the spokes@@ person of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ acy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ y of the people always fle@@ w , Prinz Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year rule at the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik has commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was s@@ wollen , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting socks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the call to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
that were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; as Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to withdraw . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the unexpected resign@@ ation of a Gre@@ ens Party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its kno@@ b A @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens of Gre@@ ens Elke T@@ westen set up her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot;
CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to commen@@ ce her faction .
&quot; CD@@ U and F@@ DP have a total of 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on the 14th of January .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to gover@@ n in this situation without majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imper@@ ative that the day of the country decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s day of parliament puts confidence in the prime minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ üm@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the resign@@ ed de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country trade .
&quot; we , of course , assume that she has received her state parliament , which she has received over the green past@@ oral list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; divided the pres@@ iden@@ ts Meta Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of Elke T@@ westen tremend@@ ously . &quot;
they have deliberately decided not to speak no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens @-@ MEP Elke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; said the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the country day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Niedersachsen the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration has her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and tries to beat political capital from it .
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ örn Th@@ üm@@ ler wishes to commen@@ ce his de@@ pu@@ ties , Elke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , raised T@@ westen with personal career gifts the result of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD most powerful force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a flat @-@ thin majority in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers safeguard themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung.de , the federal states represent the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to all we know at the moment , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the enlight@@ ener is not really perceived by the German Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the Länder .
&quot; in spite of this , my house immediately stopped and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the concerns of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and health @-@ harm@@ less .
&quot; if the resi@@ dual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not rush . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the establishments are to blame .
are factories and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production facilities are no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages due to presum@@ ably illegal practices of service providers . &quot;
as always there is too little cont@@ rol@@ le@@ ure in the harvest .
is it lacking only at the personnel or in the concl@@ usive sphere of jurisdiction ?
but there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur is crucial . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers are entitled to obtain only safe and heavy food@@ stuffs .
&quot; if a non @-@ legal insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are right@@ ly indig@@ nant . &quot;
&quot; through the provided funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is swi@@ ft@@ ly and without mos@@ quit@@ oes . &quot;
how the Financial Rules of Football at N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded editions of European football clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to for@@ ge teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
&quot; PSG is able to make money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar sign and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the weal@@ thy mi@@ stress family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations allowed to apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources , which enable them to give them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest for success , would effectively dec@@ eive themselves and risk losing themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentr@@ ating on the deb@@ ts of clubs , to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini was attacked by the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter him from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can spread the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the exp@@ ul@@ sion may be reported for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 44.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PSG collaboration with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tou@@ gh@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the crew members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ vise their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the PS@@ A sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that some of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the WC 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup Ambassador will be , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they discussed the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PSG expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owned property . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; over the past few years , choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline circul@@ ates the job .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; on request from the news agency .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small white @-@ white packaged ham panels distribute 14 grams per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume according to &quot; &quot; North Western Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves annual revenues of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a mold producer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants do it with the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;

Athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus @-@ Olympics Robert Hart@@ ing reaches World Cup Final
the three @-@ time world champion is fighting a medal on Saturday in the final .
&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , was scre@@ ened in the national F@@ WC ex@@ cre@@ tion and could only watch the disc@@ us competition from the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into the niche &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
&quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
but as Fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absur@@ d hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; step@@ ping up at the core of the g@@ ag - actors middle ages play dirty children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to gain the last part of the heat . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the found@@ ry principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That &apos;s Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sm@@ iles the cr@@ adle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point is a character of an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates , and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot to be included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as usual , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s signature style by Sing@@ les , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could radi@@ ate this fran@@ chise just like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; series until it reaches what I feel as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring@@ tone I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , announces a ti@@ led TV series : a Romanian drama of the ei@@ gh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( likewise a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan M@@ ask is involved , that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long epis@@ odes it draws , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was reduced to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American emb@@ assy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything for the fo@@ d@@ der for a bal@@ lot .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator was not wrong : we even do it with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor of Con@@ stance announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accused were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued an arrest warran@@ t against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two persons were arrested at the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two will probably be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the m@@ af@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , perpet@@ ual mur@@ ders as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; for the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor of the public prosec@@ utor against organised drug trade in southern Germany was established . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; for this reason , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 at Hü@@ pf@@ alz , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way compl@@ ains major g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report the foreig@@ ner regi@@ sters in Germany have significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a media report on large g@@ aps in the foreigners &apos; register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis conducted by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the report , 10 million people with foreign nation@@ als are reported in the register , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the Register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can slow down recur@@ ring processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on out@@ going people , citizens are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false arrangements , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with it , &quot; said it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugees families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travel@@ ed from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore means that the &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF perform such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU state . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry level . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Office is now writing : &quot; meanwhile the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy received guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; also , other EU countries would return refugees in the context of the Dublin Convention . &quot;
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ person on the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful conditions and a endanger@@ ing of the child &apos;s sleep because of the lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach already provided blood don@@ or service to other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile divided into 50 liters of blood with his 100 don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the session of the Municipal Council acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingen@@ ious how our body is created for it and we cle@@ ave respect for the don@@ ors , who provide their blood for stran@@ gers , yet un@@ sel@@ fish@@ y , &quot; Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ ach , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported from the actions that were carried out in the spring of Ober@@ reich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K county . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the switch to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta um@@ beer were among the multiple @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 hours of blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many liqu@@ eur Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while T@@ amara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave every 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice each . &quot;
Bank of England will keep rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they settled interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying print . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members active in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and previously warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation in the fall expected to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to breed the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h business package , which was published a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deci@@ ding on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to poll@@ ute consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it re@@ claimed that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger scale than the markets . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the Bank , however , empha@@ sized that &quot; &quot; enh@@ ancements &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forec@@ asted in May .
it has retained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest income , and GDP grew by 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tight@@ ening will first become even worse before getting better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent income from income &quot; &quot; in the next few years , but she added that wages to the end of its three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will again attract them over the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the bank said that the exceeding in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in the face of the recent s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages dis@@ close , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversi@@ al HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
&quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exposure phy@@ lo@@ xe ( pre@@ p ) introduced before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now provided by health services over a first three year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he volunte@@ ered to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court had confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the past year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Foundation ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first which will allow registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV therapies taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk patients .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , appropriate participants are identified that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a resident doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in tac@@ kling one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Foundation ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted on need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded test in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Higgins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ atively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that it will help us to step closer to the spreading of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , compl@@ emented by a large house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown to me in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Storage room and an intermediate floor to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ ly , so the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the pres@@ et .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked , without having to b@@ other us . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window to another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , there is a mir@@ r@@ ored units for all the fun@@ nels and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ nit@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , giving the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ence of somewhat by default into something quite aston@@ ishing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a confront@@ ation with one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ alistic Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict over the separation occurs in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family since 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family West@@ cot@@ ta founded je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth EUR 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of issue for Paul .
&quot; the ess@@ ays designed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed medi@@ tations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true but sheds Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he is hoping to settle the quar@@ rel . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 19@@ 50s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ lade of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was held back very well although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire from 2015 he was the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
m@@ umps new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ acy .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of White House plans to restri@@ ct information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief captain of the White House , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys Diagnos@@ tic makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media .
&quot; President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relation to television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was angry due to un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election team Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to b@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former elect@@ oral officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot;
pages : &#91; 1 &#93;
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these camp@@ uses do something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have even more fuel included without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators were able to keep away from him several times , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has allowed it to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of ri@@ val parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely concerned with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of the advis@@ ors , to the president for strategic reasons to supply dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone released a copy of an article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for chic@@ anes , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false acc@@ us@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
dump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the dam Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work to record the dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most searched break@@ ers get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be wor@@ shipped and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the heavy crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population will be hop@@ ed and ad@@ mon@@ ished . &quot;
Euro@@ pol has reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent@@ skal@@ ender from the winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many vol@@ ati@@ tudes were hiding in holiday destinations , called it on the part of Euro@@ pol . &quot;
there are 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online requests have been arrested until now , at least eleven of them based on evidence after publishing on the website . &quot;
travellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travelers on the foot of war , which have negoti@@ ated a tr@@ ench from the commun@@ e to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans in a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ej@@ ected only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the t@@ act@@ ful group found a gap in the def@@ ensive units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced through shame on implementation , as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot stop it once .
&quot; a residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travellers to be lo@@ oted only by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to carry on them as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our refer@@ ral collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct by the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Birk@@ enhof to Luise Wald@@ hotel Luise
&quot; from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Luise will be located . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened again on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof through the dam@@ al@@ ige ambience company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came into the district , the hotel building offered to the Coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective accommodation , provided for controversi@@ al discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the council .
&quot; however , especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke at that time from serious potential customers to the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has long been building a building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were pulled out , blan@@ kets built partly , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; really bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher level of inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tour@@ director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the exterior facilities are also brought on front mann , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which is open to the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : US special investig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian affair for US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report . &quot;
&quot; the board started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal appe@@ aled to persons entrusted with the matter . &quot;
the paper made the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there was already the first brief@@ ings of the committee in connection with a meeting between the umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to be targeted at the presidential election campaign 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps Elect@@ oral Camp@@ a@@ ign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more g@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally drew into the centre and under@@ went the repro@@ ach if the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in potential break@@ through@@ s and decide whether it is to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also referred to as acc@@ us@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversi@@ al cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for hearing .
&quot; according to the station CN@@ N , pre @-@ char@@ ms have already been exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r there were also Tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election team Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts said that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller doesn &apos;t let himself be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he , if necessary , should act quickly . &quot;
but it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the insurrection of an indictment .
&quot; nevertheless , the introduction of the atro@@ city of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme will give the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he ignor@@ es nothing of the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work , however , also usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the special designer .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ age , alleg@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were loud , he challeng@@ ed the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set the investigation against the former National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special investig@@ ator and his staff . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation on whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dism@@ iss .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg driving in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg was solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s seven @-@ fold great@@ ness of Berlin . &quot;
this gave the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus of about one tril@@ lion tons , and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , now travel to the north and will take two , three years until it was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for man does not go out of him .
the extent of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg is un@@ clear after research statements .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual frac@@ tures in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scr@@ aper .
snow@@ sho@@ eing is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it always grows to the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this paper , the balance of w@@ axes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Shel@@ f was broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it speaks a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron sheet is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if at a key point a piece is broken . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and im@@ press ice as much water as it yields after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the s@@ cour@@ ge causes the gl@@ ac@@ iers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest shr@@ ub of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic according to A@@ WI @-@ figures , with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the junction from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not a direct link to climate change , the sign of iron enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est withdrawal from the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow back in the long term and possibly summar@@ ize , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers ignore the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , many ice cu@@ dd@@ les of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been crus@@ hed over the past few decades . &quot;
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends to South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey research programme , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus en@@ vis@@ ages the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have under@@ gone . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 train@@ ees have left their first working day .
the apprenticeship places in the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 620 applications were awarded for the seats to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
there are currently 50 non @-@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann &apos;s circle .
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces in general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U now wants to take action together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and counter the short@@ age of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover current demands on skilled workers , but counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application of candidates . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for drop@@ outs and include an education offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel issues that you did not know earlier .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who fail to ex@@ crete the disease or age due to the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
he was already worried about a f@@ aust@@ ine surprise long ago when he publicly challeng@@ ed personnel expenses and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want to check all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - maybe even in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - will seek a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials as it actually stipul@@ ates the tari@@ ffs for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , raises or more money is available only if you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees have to take care of the provisions of the new constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tight@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Jugend R@@ ettet &apos; because their crew had worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organization , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to express himself with detailed acc@@ us@@ ations of the Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from &apos; Jugend R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the crew adop@@ ts ding@@ h@@ y migrants , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place at least 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is susp@@ ected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who super@@ vis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ nec@@ c@@ ess@@ ary , but acceptable as they wouldn &apos;t bring &quot; essential modifications or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy were strongly reduced in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
there were three guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed View@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the down@@ stream planes . &quot;
in between there was always leng@@ th@@ ier asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st markt .
&quot; once again , the look@@ out point turned to a look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ un@@ ched &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ let hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation san@@ atorium br@@ ine .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , instead of swe@@ ating through the St@@ adi@@ on Speed at wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
this has also recognised the first German lig@@ aments that are increasingly engaged in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there are still quite a number of clubs on this train .
&quot; the FIFA World Cup will organise the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London next weekend , where the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven have qualified for example . &quot;
Robin D@@ ut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be more often more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the soccer simulation FIFA are challeng@@ ed on a level of competition . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , li@@ lies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the 2022 @-@ matches , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly custom@@ ary . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ öse himself dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the Deutsche Sp@@ orth@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classical sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; there are also cogni@@ tive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the in@@ cis@@ ion player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ öse also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the company consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) prec@@ edes the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales tot@@ alled 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hock@@ ey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are involved in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is doing .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport was introduced as a ped@@ agog@@ ical subject , says F@@ rob@@ öse . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football club clubs according to D@@ ut@@ t are meanwhile oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ Sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; falling in no@@ stal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time align@@ ing the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ ut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t cling to it , that only football remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , forced Conrad Roy to su@@ icide , condemned &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced in June to Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured dress , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes , when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no repent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which she completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz told , however , he did not find out that her age or maturity or even her mental disease have a significant influence on her actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I surround everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person , with whom I had been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts giving it a crime to commit another su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revel@@ ations that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter insp@@ ected attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was convic@@ ted of murder at her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new mini Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ mich took up the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern wins the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ mich took me straight away , even though the additional garment was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was visible , he made the bar@@ k on his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner was afterwards behind , after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign from the coach could suggest Kim@@ me as well .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s junior players , de@@ posit@@ ors and especially from holiday . &quot;
&quot; sweet@@ ly , one distri@@ butes much to those one who wants to hold a lot , which one wants to hold in mood . &quot;
&quot; so those who were chosen to take the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ mich confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
&quot; at the right , this is his position , the white bar@@ k on her arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ mich took part in this initial report as the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , trying to ste@@ er the un@@ divided group . &quot;
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly scar@@ c@@ ely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out to join the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folded also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not negative in their first appearance in the Bavaria tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran apart from Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sover@@ eign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , and in addition Sü@@ le tried to win a few times in the game @-@ build . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hop@@ ed for . &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; rel@@ ocation , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entr@@ ances , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ mich adopted a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously d@@ une the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest turn @-@ turn looks at the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top priority of the country .
&quot; this year the ministry hopes for a plan@@ ing process , until 2021 shall be the right of construction . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ b@@ ypass Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the course in operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Officer Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier asp@@ ires , as was inspired by Wis@@ sing , with wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young train@@ ees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
a bonus of 1000 Euros for the completed Master Exam@@ ination and 2500 Euro is fores@@ een if graduates within ten years after the master degree course make themselves independent .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time lack@@ ed the country the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far . &quot;
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; based on the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U faction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf also refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less than the preservation of country roads than proposed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
they compl@@ ain about stock@@ ing Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already cleared the field for dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW President said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and he moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs of the automobile manufacturers to install exhaust gases ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles , also assume that which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having to p@@ amp@@ er the mighty auto@@ ir@@ men and to ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former director of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put into court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could possibly strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar

&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors to participate , on the morning Saturday a raft proceeds through Munich which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; who is going to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , will see a big raft there between the Fl@@ au@@ cher and the Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction committee wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish hill .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protected game flow .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Cro@@ chet @-@ n@@ oses and laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was occasionally one of the most popular cart@@ oon @-@ drawer , the pop @-@ up of his characters are his hall@@ mark . &quot;
even with 85 Argent@@ ine@@ ans still draws and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as an artist for congrat@@ ulation cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo held many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo pieces tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working daily almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find his funny figures all over the world . &quot;
he has been working on a cart@@ oon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; said Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he is rel@@ ying more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining due to the conditions which are remin@@ is@@ cent of dro@@ ught and due to diseases affecting them , causing scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence has been effectively je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised because the plant in the past years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has an effect on the service life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ad , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ ars with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials , and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own trage@@ dy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal sen@@ ti@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement from violence , and throughout the country there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now , there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their publisher and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; writes Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ walt@@ Verein was established in 2010 , in order to edit the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely seen in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more ob@@ li@@ vious . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to move freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields as ri@@ val fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only one Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cart@@ el fr@@ actions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have denied the children , susp@@ ected gang@@ lions bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved it to be able to publish harsh tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the light of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who could cur@@ l like a port worker , the friend who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
&quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they best do their job and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even at the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &apos; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were suddenly allowed . days previously known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters ques@@ tioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who signed the governor himself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are fac@@ to under control .
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce li@@ cked on three main stories . &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of the brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it happened , so cau@@ tion was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the whole century all political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken down with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to keeping signs and stick@@ ers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez &apos;s repor@@ ter sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become vo@@ iced by typ@@ ing in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on wal@@ k@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to pron@@ ounce the journalists and ref@@ rain them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society . &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were involved with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as card : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was mur@@ dered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives the drug traff@@ icking him fright@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I was repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val ri@@ val and security forces near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated on as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the boarding edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day , the J@@ avier was mur@@ dered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street for reporting . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a fright@@ ening . &quot;
now researchers discovered that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able r@@ hin@@ o of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sk@@ inn@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the imm@@ ort@@ al ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the cycle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , which describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock on the board , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only fl@@ atter a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the cre@@ ature is to be seen . &quot;
it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specim@@ ens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed to blend better into his surroundings and to escape his enemies , say the experts suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ .000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the aston@@ ishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter@@ fei@@ ting , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the head of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter@@ fei@@ ting is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceed the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confront@@ ation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter@@ fei@@ ting - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the ret@@ rob@@ ing @-@ time &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his con@@ served intestinal neck , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sunk on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sk@@ inn@@ ed skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just squ@@ e@@ eze a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the cycle time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who were on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta s@@ ank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the imm@@ ort@@ al ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely covered with the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 inches long tops that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ aters were washed by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin @-@ tr@@ ays still cover hol@@ ly ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of conservation is so &apos; rare as a winning in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole &apos; .
in th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous in@@ jured , miles @-@ long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn , Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , 20 people were in@@ jured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were between the connections between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a swe@@ ating , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , coll@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
the exact number of in@@ jured were at first no indications .
&quot; it was about light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large bid for ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely blocked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a length of approximately ten kilometres long .
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , there was also on the return road to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the signs of the vehicle anchor , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate sent@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it had come to a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : consolidated Group &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing else sits in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a geni@@ us thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an un@@ easy or stim@@ ulates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
http : / / www.b@@ ab@@ elim@@ mo@@ .com / 54@@ 7@@ 03 @-@ 0@@ 38@@ 6@@ 56 /
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the freel@@ ance chassis control .
&quot; you simply confirm by mobile phone , that you can take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valu@@ ation without she@@ art@@ ing .
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
&quot; you have to also have purchased the app from the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one goes into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the case of the test , a button for the electronic evaluation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger is located in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the tow@@ ing companion arrives at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already an already de@@ valued online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without Tick@@ et@@ control through our train staff , checked in the DB Navigator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train personally , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing Management Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives trains , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the chassis control rolls are among the biggest sleeves . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID card , or otherwise a document you have to assign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train esc@@ ort and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor ends at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b appartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped at their tim@@ eline .
&quot; rap@@ pers from the area of St. Louis marked the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ blos@@ som@@ ed body that was stretched out on the road and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police band and people that cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wor@@ e a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman declared his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can typically call .
at that moment I felt sh@@ aking fro@@ st .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that are from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l went with her daughter who wor@@ e a flower dress and a matching crown after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I have taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be pulled up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , she is no different than the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite to the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped them to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to the mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We &apos;ve heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , have not c@@ entered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his dedication brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other local people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us . we speak , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for that is how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , how she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence even though it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the raci@@ al connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though they are not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves a cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while others say : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole palaces ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size tap ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ ponents hope that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wanted to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a space with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farm market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the vag@@ inas very gladly again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers in a market hall in the gallery settle down to the level of rent .
&quot; however , this might not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , Dro@@ geri@@ e- or Super@@ markets : I find it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are plenty of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only from larger companies because the r@@ ents are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer &apos;s market going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ ess Bit gallery previously to sell all business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ sections that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it publicly announced diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combines their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created DNA that has been extracted from M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been openly condemned to identify as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette bl@@ acks and g@@ um g@@ um by extr@@ acting DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice were converted into un@@ equal bricks , which were replaced by several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; who predicted a future in which the President would convert chel@@ seas verdi@@ ct and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , that Obama was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings &apos;s release after seven brutal years would require a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ atten the rigid divisions which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning with her su@@ bli@@ me signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ ander of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological matters , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ plant of 2007 , Lux@@ urious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning how she emerg@@ es from the discipline of discipline in the United States like King Kong with an open @-@ talk phone .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted by the mas@@ ks in the middle of space , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ers , who like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ lanes were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg about portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a country @-@ wide common hunting ground is for a professor at North@@ western University and one of Oxford University staff who were chosen as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the C@@ ook County courts . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ vings . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the cor@@ p@@ ses were discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still on the spot for dead , and det@@ ectives investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police were actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ vera has now been in safety and was excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is a senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the U.S. investig@@ ators in every concei@@ vable manner .
the statement added that War@@ ren colleagues were shock@@ ed and wanted him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , rein@@ force themselves , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , the police got a call from the building manager of the grand @-@ pl@@ aza that had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 1008 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
&quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ aks and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) are being implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal from WA@@ DA to carry out dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA CEO of Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs more
these divided the groups .
&quot; it is a pure precau@@ tion , it could continue to be gone from any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was called in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pro@@ g @-@ containing anti @-@ blood vessels . &quot;
Al@@ di wanted to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , speci@@ alise specific groups and demo@@ graphic groups , to address employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to approach the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Str@@ ava and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she was a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re @-@ bore why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the foref@@ ront of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ ale , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken , were pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity in the early this year in the midst of the UFO case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ tible has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; recently , u@@ ber has recently registered as a client . &quot;
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies send bes@@ po@@ ke &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints will go directly to the super@@ visory board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ tible . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his employees treat badly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible spent more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Conver@@ tible rel@@ ies on , problems that were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ s more quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; when the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen coll@@ ap@@ sed due to ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service and poll@@ ute the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that has the consent of Venture Capital investors that have both start @-@ ups supported .
&quot; Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter@@ ing was $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employe@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In which uses both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ di@@ ties when their portfolio companies are running well . companies work well if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 contributions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow colleagues ask yourself , &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who don &apos;t care about why should I do ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , such as saved . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose clients , you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot boards and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real christ@@ mas mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was closed . &quot;
N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins shi@@ fted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practic@@ ing practical exercises . &quot;
they are to hold 18 exercises in August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the N@@ CA@@ A regulation , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really gets great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , considering the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been subjected to pe@@ eling , which is a protective net behind a door@@ step , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people have a room there and then adjust to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false feedback from third parties and display their results under the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot;
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible wrong messages and to send them to fac@@ sim@@ ile insp@@ ectors which may display results from the fact check out of the original article .
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which have influenced US presidential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers were floo@@ ded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will be supporting a plan for which social media networks should be pun@@ ished if they fail to er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization of which stories of fac@@ tions reviewed by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related articles &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen false news .
creating a comic novel : a Castle in the History of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at someone &apos;s hand , who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ ol@@ y . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb pressure on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell for smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he is also there . &quot;
&quot; ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) , this seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; for his days , RHO@@ DES spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted wat@@ cht@@ ower on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and talked with landscape hist@@ ories , garden@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees first started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who was possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be bor@@ ed , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ prising that occurred in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant revol@@ t started in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good beginning .
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it that the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portr@@ ayed from the 18th century , filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was made later years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen appeared to be quite a fence , always making deb@@ ts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise environments . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium date back to the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the bloo@@ dy life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the inaugur@@ ation of the 301 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret to Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than just &quot; &quot; just a logo and slogan , &quot; &quot; says it further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ established promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; after all , they stand in competition with other commun@@ es . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef has its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ gans fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es about comm@@ its and promotions at the officers &quot; cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Vice @-@ Vice @-@ president and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number . &quot;
the government draws the rein in the military .
&quot; the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , heads of state Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who were allegedly involved in the attempted coup , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the revolution as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an really get a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , large @-@ scale investments in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 73@@ 95 workers , including 23@@ 03 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an pressed the army &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an drives deliberately an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution abroad for asylum , the Turkish army will be full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not allow N@@ ato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance to the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will issue Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabilit@@ ate track for road@@ side transportation
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the Renn@@ steig@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been disp@@ uted - now it is supposed to be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , on the marble track , on which the tourist train leaves , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race pace , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is expected to begin this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country became particularly important for tourism , &quot; stated Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs of the hau@@ ling of the course amoun@@ ted to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country passes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , will be defini@@ tively agreed , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; with this , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot operation has been tested , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to re @-@ order them in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it cannot become even crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; the people are funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be reached by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it will still be more wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ wife look progressive . &quot;
modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have become robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female properties , the all@@ usions to r@@ ape , when one takes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : rising ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point out to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recogni@@ zes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the mar@@ g@@ inal zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offensive before the free market gives permission to them .
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has ha@@ iled to have women sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total subj@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleas@@ ing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the 2017 right of speech : maid
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound human understanding
&quot; it has become a bin@@ sen@@ ess of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elect@@ or@@ ship , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest festival , there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump @-@ sel@@ ectable relatives . &quot;
we are all rep@@ uted to let our filter bu@@ b@@ bles burst .
less noticed is the power to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ ins , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited this week in New York . &quot;
it rem@@ inded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is related to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the pres@@ tige of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ unt@@ less possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer ab@@ stain from us anymore . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a fright@@ ening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of mad@@ ness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of Cra@@ zy - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both of which were in fact a very mild criminal . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ us@@ els of the New York City Park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are hungry and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ ber music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dec@@ eive : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing while I was tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars .
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us rel@@ oc@@ ated with chest pain from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hands , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder following an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by pushing her several times through a door of the toilet box in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a night@@ ly in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cab . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , of which they say it is too pru@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ day harv@@ esters from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to the high school in future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Angelika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eag@@ le growing up in the chicken yard , but then released to freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in Hüh@@ ner@@ hof . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it fr@@ y from his chick@@ ens .
a little eag@@ le came out instead of a chicken .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it struck , and the eag@@ le spread forth his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , the cylinders had to wear around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stands for integration , said Dr. Angelika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chic@@ ks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its destiny is to be free .
she wished to every four @-@ year @-@ che@@ er that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues Michael Müller , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly j@@ umps on teaching courses , followed by the parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; she left her students after two years of teaching only very well , because it was a really great time . &quot;
finally she was able to rely on the four @-@ wheel harv@@ esters .
&quot; finally , all students made a song of sum@@ mer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ class chi@@ ppers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were im@@ pris@@ oned for illegal crimes in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tight@@ ened control of the free camp , and to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine penalty .
software update for Diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel @-@ Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission performance of vehicles of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet defined an exact date . &quot;
&quot; Daimler has told , to write to any affected person . &quot;
&quot; if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their boxes . &quot;
how long does the conver@@ sions mean ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the app@@ endi@@ ces from the engagement of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers do not act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy &apos;s Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the Awards are given at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award along with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV @-@ series , therefore announced to ref@@ rain from taking part in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burden me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will go into retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , however , suitable candidates are r@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker is Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he im@@ parts in the press room .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application does not apply the requirements profile until now . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .
this way - taking into consideration the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision .
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ stan@@ tive authority , the applicant must show corresponding conclusions . &quot;
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they can no longer fulfil them , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but Ci@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s proximity to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good working climate , as well as good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the town alive , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz is about .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be@@ ech about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
working here is fun . &quot;
&quot; styl@@ ish@@ ly , there is plenty of room for a city building master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and garden@@ er , it is possible to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , stres@@ ses the separ@@ ating city building master . &quot;
anyway the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a high responsibility .
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs on my table . &quot;
&quot; with regard to care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been part of Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , should be able to demonstrate a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of planning and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ takes civil and civil engineering , construction management planning , under@@ mining operations , management of urban properties , urban de@@ pot with building yard and urban garden@@ er , as well as lower construction law , including monument protection . &quot;
bike rides on lines : southwest line blocked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rat@@ ors had thrown the blue bike of the railway track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for them for the night hours .
near the Tat@@ ort was witnessed by witnesses a sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an empire , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant as well as the delay , and the costs for rail replacement transport , even P@@ ön@@ alen der Bahn &apos;s customers could also come to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south rail@@ road track could be guided without any disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were dropped off Friday morning , two of which were concerned about the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight elev@@ ators did not fall , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; incur@@ able in the US approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ .000 causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloo@@ dy di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during the suffer@@ ers normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant col@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too long in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance encourages immune cells in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i , which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an abundant nutrition more toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also strikes people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctor@@ ate Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which , however , had not had . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how bacteria influence the immune system , the researchers released L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an met@@ abolic disease known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ ates were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ancing cells like mice and that most of us L. rep@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans such as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ane values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United is committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; geni@@ us , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the bracket role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho announced that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner rather than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho form@@ ated his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; in this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots fle@@ w from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a dre@@ amer was to be .
the whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertising .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new Tief@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party center , merely no head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important wish of the elect@@ oral comb@@ at@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House closely monitor the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with the head@@ wind .
there were low @-@ pit@@ falls .
and one after another .
&quot; after the aston@@ ishing end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional ex@@ termination of a green parliament has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the country elections , its red @-@ green coalition was thus losing its A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked the two @-@ hour lower Sax@@ on Green Party member Elke T@@ westen to give her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elect@@ or@@ ate .
&quot; Elke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German executive and elect@@ oral campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; si@@ gh@@ s a SPD election campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob message reached the party headquarters in Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing up to CD@@ U without own government majority after the transition of the green par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , com@@ rades re@@ ass@@ uring the com@@ rades . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; this was done , too - and it was all much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pi@@ geon , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ te the party smooth . &quot;
the com@@ rades fall ar@@ du@@ ous again in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next stop .
&quot; Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried to put emphasis on acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz did not remain hidden . &quot;
they left him because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabil@@ isation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l decides no gu@@ ilt on the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
and Schulz did not do it at all .
&quot; at times , the com@@ rades make an effort to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is focused on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the sec@@ ular par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in the West . &quot;
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen poses their own career concerns over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; not because of her person , Mrs. T@@ westen was elected as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the lower Saxony Green Party in parliament , so the Lower Saxony parliament far@@ ed further . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they resign@@ ed their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD MEP , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ ers agree four years ago : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties dist@@ orts the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
funding for local histori@@ ans III
those who want to rehabilit@@ ate in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three Deputy ST@@ EC Urban Development were held on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened to date . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in Emp@@ fingen renovation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is also important to encourage inner development , not only to tap into new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding was 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area emerge ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role in rehabilit@@ ating whether in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be post@@ pon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EC contracts Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would eventually be established as a pro@@ position .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , once again , the inventory would be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill a ques@@ tionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order deadline is to be carried out as possible so that in the coming year can be started with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then stated , that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the said advance investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about evalu@@ ating and deci@@ ding the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities , and decide when will be rehabilit@@ ated and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will return to Emp@@ fingen and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be ques@@ tionnaires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow ques@@ tionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot arch &quot; , &quot; where it works among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the grey ques@@ tionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary and residential arch &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out when operating rooms are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that a filled ques@@ tionn@@ aire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , gr@@ ind first . &quot;
one cannot reserve funds for later &quot; . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; center II &quot; &quot; were shown in order to make the present a re@@ organization &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British geni@@ us is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing An@@ a@@ esthes@@ ia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm . &quot;
the costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to the South Law@@ n for an event will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter , built in Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter landed on the South Law@@ n , according to the nav@@ al helic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his su@@ peri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty chairman of the Navy for aviation . &quot;
the news showed that the helic@@ opter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South Law@@ n for the event at 3 pm and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original air@@ field crew was during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the security guards of the unit remained on the floor by plane during the time . &quot;
the recordings provided by TIME did not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal authorities to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; rep@@ lied the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ure government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ iden@@ ts are required to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation as the president &apos;s plane in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ dienste , and his Twitter account is full of messages which compl@@ ained about the use of the pres@@ idency by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy spokes@@ person of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Law@@ n to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight kit for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helic@@ opter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers did not take over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in providing helic@@ op@@ ters on the South Law@@ n .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ing for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the hourly rate of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
unit recordings record the flight time of the aircraft for 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helic@@ opter lies far below this rate .
&quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates involve staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helic@@ op@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
of course it is appropriate to highlight this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour over the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump was speaking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of the tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga occurs at the Table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will appear at the Tab@@ ellen@@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV tomorrow starting at 11 o &apos;clock .
&quot; despite five games still fl@@ aw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis Championships has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ le Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially at the rear positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV above all imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Fin@@ n can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment , at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing in the Czech Republic for his first use this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ eans Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vic@@ tories against the Club on the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back to the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still number one of the Junior World rank@@ ings in January 2016 , does not fill anyone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay den K@@ ader . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not perform when he sat down his signature under the law to intensi@@ fy sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ref@@ usal to give the law , &quot; &quot; the congress had packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the U.S. thrust . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that will help the Russi@@ ans to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 in cooperation with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even per Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed , which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the spot@@ light of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which un@@ vei@@ ls Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed up the latest install@@ ers of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful go@@ d@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company with more government hol@@ dings and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican alliance , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites US and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ ution authorities to support war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;

roll back : the city presents 46 kitchen@@ ettes
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita L@@ unch itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock has been revers@@ ed in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres .
&quot; as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled in addition to house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children &apos;s premises , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last day , 2,@@ 800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time employees will have kitchen service starting September 1 : they warm the delivered food , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group institutions - decides on the scope of the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because also this is : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children are supposed to help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the k@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that they have exhibited in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign awar@@ ding for the city as the most economical one , it is said of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ om , Head of Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled in the elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provin@@ cial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Tali@@ ban has released threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will send the power peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ mans said , a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
Afgh@@ an independent elect@@ oral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers .

men try to break 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 years should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked about the 13 year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 pm , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 year old refused the request and continued with their friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors tried to attack the mobile phone and necklace of the girl , but they failed . &quot;
&quot; without prey , the duo fle@@ w . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ m@@ b Conc@@ eption about Invest@@ ments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make certain of the long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow via managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; G@@ m@@ b Scotland said , the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work at work , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits besides other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first to experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch director of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; &quot; vo@@ iced concerns that funding for modernis@@ ing production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ m@@ b Senior Organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow - an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern End of Glasgow is des@@ per@@ ately a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; said Pl@@ adi@@ s : &quot; &quot; the Leader at T@@ oll@@ cross was only yesterday receiving a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe economic climate , constantly check our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and entirely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PSG wanted Barcelona three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La Liga page likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not ref@@ unded after N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issu@@ ing an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release cl@@ ause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world murder case ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although there is a source near the Catalan board that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of the PSG President three years ago before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG @-@ center player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PSG made it clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter re@@ formed and damaged
&quot; in the night from Friday to Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator has deliberately turned down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage caused by over 200 Euro . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for references . &quot;
an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for witnesses to the police .
&quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the control plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger came to meet him in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver touched the gui@@ del@@ ine .
&quot; at the passenger car , plant damage was caused . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the mer@@ ced@@ es@@ aw had not noticed the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks for witnesses to the incident , as well as the driver of the distributor , to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse inci@@ dents was reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen takes care of discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he was expecting a ap@@ ology from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the master @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events at that time .
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed that in reporting about violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a bound fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blow@@ s have been a quite normal educational means , &quot; to be done with nau@@ ght@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on abuse inci@@ dents , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the sou@@ venir sheet &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with enlight@@ enment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg , Germany from 1964 to 1994 . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more fier@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims of R. este@@ emed the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal was reli@@ eved at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence of violence against dust mit@@ es at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ eric and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which became tan@@ gible if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz made no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bio@@ grapher ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you get the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in general . &quot;
he is dedicated especially to eight pages and is clearly exemp@@ t from any suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ wife or fellow men in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the mass of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him , experience it too late , or have taken the first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , on which he worked , was conceived by virtually all respon@@ dents , as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent witness , describes him as &quot; warm heart@@ y , &quot; &quot; very popular , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always enc@@ um@@ ber@@ ed by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compl@@ aining about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to w@@ ut@@ ching . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cr@@ ack with chairs and threw the bow@@ ls on the ground , but also pulled up the ears and too nau@@ ght@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has promised himself a few years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the ques@@ tion@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each one of us born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a national gram@@ mar school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are frei@@ ght@@ ful Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; so one wonders whether it &apos;s not more familiar with his or her role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media had just cr@@ acked on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who have never understood him , are still free@@ zing . &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , there was a lot of reports on mis@@ use in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any involvement or involvement in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master chapel .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the true problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tion@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absur@@ d , to assume that it is expected to have opened up ... Bu@@ ben initi@@ ate or clear@@ er , or even more , than vis @-@ à @-@ vis their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
the report conclu@@ des with the clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the study .
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any involvement . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused of being unable to prevent it or have brought it to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these contradi@@ c@@ tory crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence of violence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; seeing signs &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; clean separated : between the primary school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other acc@@ us@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the report covers inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of s@@ adi@@ stic teachers were sett@@ ling and painted , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the gymn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no s@@ adi@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this is also true for George R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. appreciated , and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most , the acc@@ us@@ ation remains to be looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish himself and of his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not willing to hear and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely closed the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral blog gymn@@ asium , which even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out that , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test punishment would continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing pun@@ ishments were not b@@ anned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us knows yet . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always looked away . &quot;
this is not true .
only in 1980 the death penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of evalu@@ ating the past according to the present moral standards . &quot;
there the prin@@ cess was right .
&quot; but that is , of course , not for sexual abuse , which was horri@@ ble at all times and not for what was verb@@ alized in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the past . &quot;
&quot; this is all terrible , and I am glad that it will finally work . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ nest@@ lings and in the hair and ears were widespread in the 19@@ 70@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment was then b@@ anned , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his ra@@ iny day , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned to you in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ gel@@ penalty also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not deny that he was there a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank until then , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not make any big singers and before any success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ coming together . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks on their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ faith , deep @-@ believing and sin@@ cere people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something like a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in contact with him , as many former dom@@ spar@@ ks still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his authorisation , visit him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them closer to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certain that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to whom she still looks , and which she rever@@ es . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are education methods that were at the time of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ o@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the propri@@ ety would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired great mer@@ its and without outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
