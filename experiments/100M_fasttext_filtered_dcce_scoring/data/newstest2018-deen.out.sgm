<seg id="1">1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows everybody who had to excite, because the car-Navi took a green meadow instead of a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria within the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large map of the map, more detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally withdrew from the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801 there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt for Munich originates from 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was built 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasantry against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: with the zoom out there appears a small-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers from the so-called" "primordial" "derived from which the land tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are small plots there today no more farmers - but small gardeners of the" "Land in Sonne". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 19th century site, was actually a meadow - and no concrete walls."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's au-Haidhausen area not only the street names "at Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Fan" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with heralvors."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüfter."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed up the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"furthermore, he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was space for 280 patients, and later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk ramp in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "- in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Irrenburg, was destroyed by bombing raids during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was marked in 1856 as the" main square, "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufhof Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies broke into the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof where these days were pre-work and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28th August 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and are listed here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discriminations, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who disproportionate disproportionate to minorities, said NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of citizens' rights which people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped for their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist decay against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no petrol over the state and taken in custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by Missouri's Office of General Councils, in which black drivers in the state are more likely to hold 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be prepared to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classifies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration agreements, which will contribute to the ACLU view of further breed profile."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have submitted an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court grave of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-place association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his operations, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Schwarzwaldmilch "is for him the alternate marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the ordination project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green land care for a lot of work, a lot needs to be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elder company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the support of the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the afforestation of areas could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open-plan area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiß stood firm: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Agency (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of a sponsorship drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be traceable (slope gradient above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's bachelor project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open-plan area is 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged assault on Saddam Hussein at the Firdes Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Sixt in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed their meaning, and in particular the importance that you were attributed than the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller was called Acosta," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your rubbish, your arms, your oppressed masses, who long longed to breathe freely, the eleventful waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "misery" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the ties between French and American republicism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this long ago."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty leaves no one, but rather an early neo-conservatives that brings the American flame into the reclaimed world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh pushed here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is wholly and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, elding, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not lighten the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two villi belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Industrial Director of the United Kingdom's Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017 announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the athletics of the UK has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her surrender's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medallists who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" "incredible" "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should watch after a great season, which included the victory with the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "hugely proud" "to the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will be mixed with the medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate mates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athlete, athletes who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't bevel at a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shook at the criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are guided like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governor dismissed the statement as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a return reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governement in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to link himself to his voters and to show his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons appearing on the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hoose's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the picture of scrolls or spammers or hassers, which vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hoose Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hate-filled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the Comments section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governor designated as" concentrated spam "attack, others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical bodies and to arrest or prevent demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accusing Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they joined a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable account had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied, between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers telling Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions, which criticised the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not bring them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes on home comforts in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European Union No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comforts over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>

<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the British Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"this really feels particularly", "said the player home in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I have not able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken in the year after I gained it, from the program."</seg>
<seg id="217">To come back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on homeland."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," "said Orr, the man from Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you can also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy about how far it has gone.</seg>

<seg id="232">"over the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking."</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 pulmonary cancer cases are attributable to passive smoke," said Dr. Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="239">"construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and" "lie reasonably in the time," "said the director of the farm Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much to be seen in the underground, which is not marked in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"the traffic, which keeps the construction work again and again, represents a big problem for the Bautrupp of the company Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of the motorists in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous," said Heinze. "</seg>

<seg id="248">"when Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she does not use a stove."</seg>
<seg id="249">It even rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regentship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually denotes a sweet potato - locally as" nota "- directly into the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour the charred tuber is removed and swallowed up with freezing hands.</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei sits on the loam floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless space serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were assigned to her."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, too late to work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around after 5pm in the village," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for the independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, who maintains the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and Western Papua, where the independent part Papua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">Enarotali is as remote as it is. the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the car rental.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="263">"the city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and made of corrugated board roofs, which have been converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust."</seg>

<seg id="265">"before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped God named Uga Tamee."</seg>
<seg id="266">There were other changes.</seg>
<seg id="267">"we were not used to wear these clothes," Degei says and points to her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock. "</seg>
<seg id="268">"in the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="269">"Papua is in Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia."</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">"the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport produced gold and copper in the value of $3.1 billion."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua has over wood resources valued at $78 billion."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia's mighty military retains a suffocating presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">"Papuanic demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose, and are treated mercilessly."</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas's tribal estate in the 1970-s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year."</seg>
<seg id="280">"" "we Become Everything" "is called in a report from the Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year include, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrostrokes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week occurs," "says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia explorer for Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="282">The bolts have intensified since Papuas resources are supplying a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are from the populations-rich islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="293">"on December 7, 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the dark."</seg>

<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting buns and brought the orphaned dance - in the circle constantly and a bird song imitating - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some demonstrators began to drag stones to police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal radio:" "if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," "says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released to local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home."</seg>

<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings arrived only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura expressed a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims, and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, security Minister Wiranto said that he was an extrajudicial mechanism for relying historical human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred long ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations, but there are processes that must be undergone," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="335">"after buried the corpses, the military sought me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not stopped.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>

<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>

<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested under the pretext of" "safeguarding national sovereignty." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a" "tragic, forgotten place." ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">The people here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over the course of time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire."</seg>

<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission was given to them."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia-director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Joko's electoral campaign, the limitations of reporting, were not realized, in order to promote transparency and development."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's unsettled provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua, including Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the Human Right Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence and insisted on" We want freedom, "according to a source which also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua will probably not vote for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai committees," "says Gobi, the chairman of the tribal council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi know that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educators and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobi states that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they do not need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shot victims led a last symbolic act of defiance: the dead of a sacrifice was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>

<seg id="425">"now, Musk says: from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63000 has already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been elevated to his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a period that ran out on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil-near ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt announced that he will postpone the observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfering with local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a long time a reliable adversary of strict environmental regulations."</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanol terminals."</seg>

<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA often ignored the deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indicted by activists groups and others, and in an agreement to determine the date for carrying out," Pruitt said that the EPA was charged more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius line is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and conveyors of Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique dörfliches Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Uranus book." "count Hermann von Sulz sold" "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the words of the document, there was also a glorious courtyard, which belonged to the Church or the patron saint, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still recognizable today in the local constellation of Tumlingen, the" "mountain" "of the third, the magnificent settlement centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 are underlining these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was created from the early medieval church of the Eighth church.</seg>

<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) windows were cut and the bell shafts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church-chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Ruins of the church threatened 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the deaths of hearers."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night, a storm broke the church tower and the half crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim turns" "no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" "Boisheim wanders" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government had not approve Düsseldorf because of a fault."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval letter is still unlawful and therefore withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim. "</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of affairs: the City Council again resolved the wind-concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a approval by the District Government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "at this point the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding writing has been received by the circle of Viersen since last week," said a spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it for the occasion to re-examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">But they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express himself to the reasoning of the" "Boisheim" "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, was closed for lease agreements with the owner of the land of about 65 hectares."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen's City Council established green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windfarm Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team can better cope with the experience in preparation with the three-legged chain than with the quadruple.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in Aue," his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have just in the Triple-Positions at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build good", "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the condition is, however, that we are even better harmonising and we do not afford to do so many aberrations in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know so 100% where they are currently standing," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, guests from the Rhineland as an easy favorite on Sunday go to the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we can sweep them away, just because we have the right to get under the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with just one defeat against Aue out of nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to forge teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG is able to make money loose, so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the wealthy mistress family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations allowed to apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources, which enable them to give them the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debt in their quest for success, would effectively deceive themselves and risk losing themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs, to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini was attacked by the presidency in Ungnade 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter him from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can spread the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the expulsion may be reported for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG collaboration with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the crew members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to supervise their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies, which are connected to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"exactly that happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the WC 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Cup Ambassador will be, and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out."</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>

<seg id="1263">Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation on a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they settled interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying print."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with less members active in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and previously warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation in the fall expected to rise to just under 3%."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to breed the inflation heated by the Brexit and it said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mammoth business package, which was published a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to pollute consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it reclaimed that" a certain streamlining of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat bigger scale than the markets. "</seg>

<seg id="1273">"the Bank, however, emphasized that" "enhancements" "would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>

<seg id="1276">The pound fell to this news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound fell by 0.5% to 1,31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 euros."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of interest income, and GDP grew by 0.2% in the preceding three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>

<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rate increased, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped by 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and will again attract them over the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV therapies taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk patients.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>

<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the entire potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as it is targeted and implemented on a large scale."</seg>

<seg id="1308">"prep, if it is targeted on needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded test in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>

<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadows Health Minister said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformatively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, complemented by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne Storage room and an intermediate floor to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overly, so the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the preset.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked, without having to bother us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window to another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, there is a mirrored units for all the funnels and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furnitered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so that when you push the door, it is very easy to slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is valued," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, giving the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meterence of somewhat by default into something quite astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>

<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family since 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the family Westcotta founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth EUR 176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the essays designed by Colin have left him with what I considered for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed meditations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true but sheds Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he is hoping to settle the quarrel."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Ms. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicatessen business from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Mumps new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's media abstacy.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of White House plans to restrict information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief captain of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostic makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relation to television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidat Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince," "said the former election team Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to bumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Pages: [1]</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campuses do something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have even more fuel included without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators were able to keep away from him several times, their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has allowed it to prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of rival parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - entirely concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors, to the president for strategic reasons to supply doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone released a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Dump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the dam Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork to record the dump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened again on March 1st next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the damalige ambience company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came into the district, the hotel building offered to the Councillor as a collective accommodation, provided for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel site.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time from serious potential customers to the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is rearranged, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "really bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer puts it."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewelry,"</seg>

<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourdirector Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-affair: US special investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury in a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the board started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal appealed to persons entrusted with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper made the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there was already the first briefings of the committee in connection with a meeting between the umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted at the presidential election campaign 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps Electoral Campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more gumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally drew into the centre and underwent the reproach if the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in potential breakthroughs and decide whether it is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also referred to as accusations."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for hearing.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the station CNN, pre-charms have already been exhibited, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr there were also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election team Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts said that the introduction shows that Mueller doesn't let himself be intimidated in his work and that he, if necessary, should act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the insurrection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the introduction of the atrocity of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme will give the democrats a chance to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he ignores nothing of the substitution of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, also usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special designer.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something changed, it was in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rausage, allegations against Trump were loud, he challenged the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set the investigation against the former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to U.S. media, the White House gathered material against the special investigator and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation on whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress like in the Watergate affair, the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic Eisberg was solved by the Schelfeis seven-fold greatness of Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This gave the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus of about one trillion tons, and 5800 square kilometers, now travel to the north and will take two, three years until it was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for man does not go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent of climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear after research statements.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual fractures in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C scraper.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Snowshoeing is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows to the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this paper, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Shelf was broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"it speaks a lot about the fact that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if at a key point a piece is broken."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and impress ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the scourge causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in small dimensions, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest shrub of the Antarctic according to AWI-figures, with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the junction from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is not a direct link to climate change, the sign of iron enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest withdrawal from the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will continue to grow back in the long term and possibly summarize, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers ignore the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice cuddles of the Antarctic Peninsula have been crushed over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus envisages the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU calls to leave the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs in the administration have undergone."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative district in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeship places in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were awarded for the seats to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 non-occupied places in Mettmann's circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as forces in general administration."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take action together with the FDP and UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover current demands on skilled workers, but counteract the future-oriented application of candidates."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, to show concrete measures for dropouts and include an education offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel issues that you did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who fail to excrete the disease or age due to the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"thus, highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already worried about a faustine surprise long ago when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and startled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want to check all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - maybe even in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - will seek a Haustarif," so people. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials as it actually stipulates the tariffs for public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly pre-written, raises or more money is available only if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees have to take care of the provisions of the new constitutional law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrants lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs have no new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister Marco Minni in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German Relief Organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had worked together effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organization, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to express himself with detailed accusations of the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that the crew adopts dinghy migrants, which can be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place at least 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to abide by the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unneccessary, but acceptable as they wouldn't bring" essential modifications or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minni said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy were strongly reduced in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy Trials and Sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed Viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the downstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there was always lengthier ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurst markt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"once again, the lookout point turned to a lookout point, connected by" flounched "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inlet huts brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhale in the open-air inhalation sanatorium brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt has also been controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in future, the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the Stadion Speed at wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first German ligaments that are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports division in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that there are still quite a number of clubs on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"the FIFA World Cup will organise the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London next weekend, where the gamers compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example."</seg>

<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-old, that young people also go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the soccer simulation FIFA are challenged on a level of competition."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sport, lilies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the 2022-matches, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly customary."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froböse himself dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classical sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"there are also cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the incision player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Froböse also sees problems:" doping is becoming increasingly a topic. "</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) precedes the e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales totalled 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-competition Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Also in Europe a lot is doing.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, E-sport was introduced as a pedagogical subject, says Froböse."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the football club clubs according to Dutt are meanwhile obligated to set up an E-Sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," "says VfB-CEO Röttgermann."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"falling in nostalgia, and to clear the old times, is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitalized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years were exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June to Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free up to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured dress, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downwards eyes, when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility taken over," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters lawyer said it was a" terrible circumstance, which she completely regrets. "</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz told, however, he did not find out that her age or maturity or even her mental disease have a significant influence on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want to be proud of me and how I surround everything. I try, in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us, for his sisters there," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person, with whom I had been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts giving it a crime to commit another suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revelations that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family on vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter inspected attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"to the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox was convicted of murder at her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sentiments."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement from violence, and throughout the country there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now, there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their publisher and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," writes Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder-BundesanwaltVerein was established in 2010, in order to edit the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated according to the committee for the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely seen in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more oblivious."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we are suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelfth River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to move freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only one Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have denied the children, suspected ganglions bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the toxicity problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be able to publish harsh tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "is a way of life," "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the light of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who could curl like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best do their job and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even at the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that 'smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. days previously known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who signed the governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce licked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the whole century all political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of high-caliber cases."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have looked at Valdez's column as the most informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken down with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to keeping signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Miriam Ramirez's reporter snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become voiced by typing in organised protests" SOS Press "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pronounce the journalists and refrain them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his final book" "Narco Journalism", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were involved with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Wächtergruppe" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas card: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives the drug trafficking him frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and so I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer, when all their telephones began to summon."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with rival rival and security forces near the beach Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated on as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the boarding edge, they released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez cast a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "said Bojorquez," "when on the same day, the Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the street for reporting."</seg>

<seg id="1924">Now researchers discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable rhino of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his skinny skin was reddish brown - and they said they had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the immortal armored dinosaurs, ever found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the cycle between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers, which describe it as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock on the board, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only flatter a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed to blend better into his surroundings and to escape his enemies, say the experts suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counterfeiting, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the head of the creature darker was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counterfeiting is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceed the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure through meat eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counterfeiting - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the retrobing-time", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conserved intestinal neck, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sunk on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skinned skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squeeze a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cycle time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, who were on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the immortal armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely covered with the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inches long tops that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eaters were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin-trays still cover holly armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as a winning in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I get it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin cover still the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblossomed body that was stretched out on the road and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return to tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police band and people that cried, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman declared his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shaking frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that are from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell went with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a matching crown after Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I have taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "remember what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take her away," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be pulled up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a latent racism, she is no different than the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite to the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped them to pass on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism completely changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to the mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan recently stated in an interview," We've heard that people born and raised in Ferguson, have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt-occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his dedication brought the project nearer to Ferrell, along with six other local people followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us. we speak," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for that is how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though they are not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while others say:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "That would be real class" "(Nicole palaces), comes from the other side:" "no man" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "size tap!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents hope that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">Galerie-Macher wanted to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda space with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the vaginas very gladly again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery settle down to the level of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, Drogerie- or Supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are plenty of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are rented in a shopping centre only from larger companies because the rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (# 1.01 Pilot) (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmer's market going to be during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the Gespeness Bit gallery previously to sell all business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarsections that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after it publicly announced diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created DNA that has been extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly condemned to identify as a woman since puberty, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy black-white selfie, sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette blacks and gum gum by extracting DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated mice were converted into unequal bricks, which were replaced by several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "Suppressed Images", "who predicted a future in which the President would convert chelseas verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, that Obama was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings's release after seven brutal years would require a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to flatten the rigid divisions which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her sublime signature, among them (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousander of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological matters, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-plant of 2007, Luxurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of discipline in the United States like King Kong with an open-talk phone.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who salutes from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of space, from their own genomic simulers, who like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplanes were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A country-wide common hunting ground is for a professor at Northwestern University and one of Oxford University staff who were chosen as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County courts."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the corpses were discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still on the spot for dead, and detectives investigates the stitches as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail explaining that Lavera has now been in safety and was excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is a senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the U.S. investigators in every conceivable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demands the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them, reinforce themselves," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"said Guglielmi, the police got a call from the building manager of the grand-plaza that had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"said Guglielmi, it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Laaks and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents:" "the police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) are being implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK anti-doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "said Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-implementation of Rusada and recently published on the website of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list stipulates that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has an error. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"at the beginning of the day Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">Rusada was excluded in November 2015 in the course of doping scandal from WADA to carry out doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping (UKAD)."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA CEO of Olivier Niggli declared that Rusada moves" in the right direction "to be used again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, specialise specific groups and demographic groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to approach the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she was a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re-bore why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that at the forefront of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandale, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment, with those who have spoken, were punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups, such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion value, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convertible, the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity in the early this year in the midst of the UFO case in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"Convertible has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"recently, uber has recently registered as a client."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like Glint, Convertible companies send bespoke" pulse "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the main business leader is involved, complaints will go directly to the supervisory board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convertible. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that his employees treat badly or behave ethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convertible spent more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the Convertible relies on, problems that were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns more quickly identified and addressed."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">"when the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convertible offer your software as a service and pollute the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that has the consent of Venture Capital investors that have both start-ups supported.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convertible received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it cannot become even crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye-color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will still be more worrying, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-wife look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppets have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible, warms the True Companion website."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female properties, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step on Frigid (called here: rising) Farrah, troubled one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then do not have Roxxxy?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point out to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is leakened out of the marginal zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive before the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has hailed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of Magd ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjection."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange at the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is related to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the prestige of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and trump, we refer to the gruntless possibility that his kittens will no longer abstain from us anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of madness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of Crazy - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both of which were in fact a very mild criminal."</seg>

<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker is Stadtbaumeister."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he imparts in the press room.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes that no application does not apply the requirements profile until now."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This way - taking into consideration the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a substantive authority, the applicant must show corresponding conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they can no longer fulfil them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but Citizen's proximity to the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who speaks of a good working climate, as well as good atmosphere between authority and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back to the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the town alive," he is sure about the building office and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-area and the Niederhofenparkplatz is about.</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still subject."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will beech about 1.5 million euros to beech if we do it right," Wacker appreciates. "</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">Working here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"stylishly, there is plenty of room for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own Bauhof and gardener, it is possible to react flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," "Wacker, and the design of the green plants often praised by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have an eye on what fits" when new buildings are approved, stresses the separating city building master. "</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway the Stadtbaumeister carries a high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything runs on my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with regard to care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been part of Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"who wants to bury Roland Wacker, should be able to demonstrate a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of planning and planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2565">Bike rides on lines: southwest line blocked</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike of the railway track transfer in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and are looking for them for the night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the Tatort was witnessed by witnesses a scooter and a bike rider.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lusatian empire," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also endanger the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay, and the costs for rail replacement transport, even Pönalen der Bahn's customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railroad track could be guided without any disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten people were dropped off Friday morning, two of which were concerned about the correspondence."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight elevators did not fall, but they had delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"incurable in the US approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during the sufferers normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant colon."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in food cannot penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too long in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance encourages immune cells in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an in tryptophan abundant nutrition more tolerant, less inflamed intestinal milieus, if the same system also strikes people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, had not had."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria influence the immune system, the researchers released L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolic disease known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if tryptophanates were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerancing cells like mice and that most of us L. repteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan side-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans such as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential can lead high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population.</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United is committed to Nemanja Matic</seg>
<seg id="2605">"at Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a" genius, "believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2606">"the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday, and impressing in the bracket role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will."</seg>
<seg id="2607">"Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation-Asia-tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what Mourinho announced that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season."</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho. "</seg>
<seg id="2609">We will help him sooner rather than later.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"new Tiefschlag for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem"</seg>
<seg id="2623">"as the wind rotates: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social-democratic prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"only no fire from the party center, merely no headwind from the Bund, was the most important wish of the electoral combatants."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-House closely monitor the events in the SPD-governed state capitals."</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with the headwind.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were low-pitfalls.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the astonishing end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green can simply not be reliable," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber the editorial network of Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising factional extermination of a green parliament has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the country elections, its red-green coalition was thus losing its A-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German Executive Director Michael Kellner asked the two-hour lower Saxon Green Party member Elke Twesten to give her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," "said the German executive and electoral campaign manager of the Greens to the Editorial Board of Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true at all," "sighs a SPD election campaign, when the new Hiob message reached the party headquarters in Friday morning."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing up to CDU without own government majority after the transition of the green parliamentarians."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD federations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2643">"after the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"this was done, too - and it was all much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pigeon, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth."</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades fall arduous again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just stepped up new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next stop.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie, while his city burned."</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"due to the VW-exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, Weil tried to put emphasis on accents."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz did not remain hidden."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They left him because they spoke of Weil a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">"now, the exact opposite could occur."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil decides no guilt on the party-internal compulsion of the Lower Saxony Green Party."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz did not do it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"at times, the comrades make an effort to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is focused on the Greens, and here above all on the secular parliamentarians in the West."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten poses their own career concerns over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the Editorial Board of Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"not because of her person, Mrs. Twesten was elected as a direct candidate, but on the national list of the lower Saxony Green Party in parliament, so the Lower Saxony parliament fared further."</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that they resigned their mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event will cost taxpayers according to the military, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green white Sikorsky VH-3D known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the naval helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors, the deputy chairman of the Navy for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 pm and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original airfield crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the security guards of the unit remained on the floor by plane during the time."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME did not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal authorities to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could harm the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," replied the Deputy Commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"on the event, the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform, which was in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to insure government rules."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump carried out an investigation as the president's plane in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, Taxidienste, and his Twitter account is full of messages which complained about the use of the presidency by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy spokesperson of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to suspend U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for" "Made in America" "event counted for the training needs of the flight kit for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in providing helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not stop budgeting for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the hourly rate of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund set for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Unit recordings record the flight time of the aircraft for 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"determining the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is most misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates involve staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are produced in America," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to highlight this.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump was speaking to representatives of Sikorsky and joking with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on abuse incidents, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the souvenir sheet" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg, Germany from 1964 to 1994."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims of R. esteemed the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal was relieved at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence of violence against dust mites at the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a conflicting image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible if a Domspatz made no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you get the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in general."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated especially to eight pages and is clearly exempt from any suspicion of the midwife or fellow men in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The mass of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him, experience it too late, or have taken the first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was conceived by virtually all respondents, as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent witness, describes him as" warm hearty, "" very popular, "" sincerely, "" competent "and" understandable, "as a very good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always encumbered by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to wutching."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only crack with chairs and threw the bowls on the ground, but also pulled up the ears and too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he has promised himself a few years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each one of us born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a national grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, these are freightful Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"so one wonders whether it's not more familiar with his or her role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just cracked on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope many people who have never understood him, are still freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, there was a lot of reports on misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any involvement or involvement in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "said one of the sufferers for the others," "It was very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in relation to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd, to assume that it is expected to have opened up... Buben initiate or clearer, or even more, than vis-à-vis their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">The report concludes with the clear result: "that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any involvement."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused of being unable to prevent it or have brought it to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these contradictory crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence of violence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "seeing signs" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"clean separated: between the primary school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"moreover, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were settling and painted, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "pre-school" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this is also true for George Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims of the general humanity of R. appreciated, and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most, the accusation remains to be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish himself and of his predecessors at a school where he was not willing to hear and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger resolutely closed the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral blog gymnasium, which even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out that," "that in the pre-school the test punishment would continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when testing punishments were not banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"prior to that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us knows yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria from Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" snare of anachronism, "so the danger of evaluating the past according to the present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that is, of course, not for sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and not for what was verbalized in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the past."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all terrible, and I am glad that it will finally work."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earnestlings and in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment was then banned, he has kept strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his rainy day, Georg Ratzinger returned to you in the talks with you for the book" My brother of the Pope? ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prügelpenalty also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not deny that he was there a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank until then, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone one does not make any big singers and before any success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-coming together."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger quite well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-faith, deep-believing and sincere people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do something like a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in contact with him, as many former domsparks still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his authorisation, visit him, read him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certain that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom she still looks, and which she reveres."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you reproach him are education methods that were at the time of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a media scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the propriety would command a 93-year-old man, who had acquired great merits and without outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
