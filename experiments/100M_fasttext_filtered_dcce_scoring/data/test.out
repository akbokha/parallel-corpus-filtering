Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always get into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has now made Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
I always get stuck in drawers or glu@@ ed from outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality .
I myself have not the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more sn@@ ug@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ac@@ tress sp@@ ends her time at home , former television with lock@@ wise d@@ ut@@ t and mex@@ ican food , says it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the White @-@ glu@@ t she brings the question of the wish : &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new mother Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger Recei@@ ves the Sports Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they drove home to the for@@ age tro@@ ug@@ hs in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and then the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - was again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even s@@ wear for photo purposes . &quot;
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistant handed over the man from An@@ hausen within a small g@@ ala the golden sport pyramid .
&quot; for awards , it does not l@@ essen the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; Cross @-@ Cross , Silver Lor@@ el@@ leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already beg@@ ged him .
the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time winner winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder , Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer &apos;s Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer &apos;s Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ pert Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jumping runner Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these le@@ gends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society wander@@ ed into the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ equal in tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to bri@@ gh@@ ten the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has a dis@@ advant@@ aged chance and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes are increased for the rich , they say . &quot;
interest@@ ingly both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; so on Tr@@ ump , there could be even cross @-@ party discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and restart the coal mining industry in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement intends to cancel it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of us don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but rather simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger p@@ enny .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs to rise , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics respect him , so the defic@@ it would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman fled with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who flee alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby there which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ etop .
until she realis@@ es that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ try .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten them torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ bear@@ er . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ wei@@ gh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ g@@ boats demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inf@@ erior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the housing in the Munich south are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children have not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often fail to help , there are more than just for them , asking B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District Churches are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Franconia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ving the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women escaped not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Franconia there are some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or will be accommod@@ ated together with men and women , it may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection , one can read at the crowds , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have talked about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant physicians : demands for new working combat measures
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have ad@@ ministered to deal with the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained persistent , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challeng@@ ed official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating working combat measures , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes lead to the fact that assist@@ ants argu@@ ed six times this year , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions , had been recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he informed B@@ MA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assistant physicians and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for physicians in England would be mandatory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ speaking hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot refuse the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iled , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved like this would never happen . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm rather seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fight against the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
building up again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
&quot; the most serious were the alleg@@ ations of leading officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in Syria areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use by President Erd@@ og@@ an he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been enth@@ r@@ alled at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat almost his ministry last month .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harsh - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ imperial assault on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian import will be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted transfer of power as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing cru@@ ll about the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pi@@ vot@@ al to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian president certainly won a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in favour of elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep@@ ening fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an analysis of the &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West , and are now being treated poor@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ iden@@ ts were told at the press conference that they did not even sei@@ ze the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided addressing a question of their differences , while Putin chose to acc@@ entu@@ ate them . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian f@@ ighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least once again talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost coll@@ ap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O shift to Nat@@ West will be changed . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail banking , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand and the brand that our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sporting sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , as how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the leader . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
&quot; but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection &quot;
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champ@@ agne after a double at New@@ market who brings it 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ck@@ ey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ dil@@ ection trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Itali@@ ener is the sixth Jo@@ ck@@ ey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the jubil@@ ation when he cat@@ ches the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the ste@@ ep@@ le race - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 493 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he achieved this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scor@@ ed 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered from the UK for nearly 30 years what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an unbeliev@@ able jo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying F@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British fl@@ ax for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournament winners , including his famous &quot; &quot; Gl@@ ori@@ ous Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a crash cy@@ mb@@ al and received a prohibition of drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulty at first when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic force to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue on competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has deliberately dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dismis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a dep@@ uty since 2012 , became his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin site , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the log head and staff of the government staff . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has secre@@ ted Moscow secre@@ tly .
&quot; for a long time , Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confidential Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff resign@@ ed on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ ant post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office had viol@@ ated the Constitution . &quot;

puzzles for fish who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help with the identification of fishes who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spect@@ acle in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : crossing the Bridge with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four lock@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; outer blo@@ wers &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine rop@@ es . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Kei@@ th Brown &apos;s economic minister today took a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is getting ready for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ end and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower located in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate work .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances of which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e r@@ n@@ li ambul@@ ance station hit on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved on from their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came abo@@ ard the ship @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered off when the bo@@ oth@@ s were drag@@ ged off by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
somebody has awak@@ ened today about these men .
hard to hurt - man sm@@ ells on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously in@@ jured .
&quot; as the police reported yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
instead the alcohol @-@ li@@ zed perpet@@ r@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ jured at the hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ erts his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her life @-@ mate .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women returned the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old created his sister and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think that investors should become much stronger in the future .
how do I react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD pro@@ poses a &quot; concept of action &quot; to the next council session .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it concerns the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the major dispute in the town hall was , however , said , &quot; How can you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as possible as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing project , which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed , is intended to provide incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so fr@@ ying : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few pres@@ crip@@ tions as possible .
the left wants even harder constra@@ ints for investors .
&quot; regardless of the Brat@@ man , there is a tight@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program does not stand entirely : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of more about 1300 budget apartments whose funding is going out in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
&quot; to prevent this , such as the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ designed to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the West city run out to the end of the year .
approximately 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West city is dras@@ tically increased , it is far from the goal of so @-@ called mix . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; chief executive Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teen@@ agers and child no longer walk outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then limited to video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later from it a cart@@ oon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many of the phenomena of pop culture , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tracking with a GPS and , once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the cock and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users recently informed the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of market launch , the number of down@@ stream people running every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people that look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ estimated . &quot;
those who regularly drive sports reduces their chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to address them here . &quot;
but the wonder of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ur@@ ian spo@@ ilers that must always compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
there has been a break@@ through .
&quot; even when smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its attraction and the use will be ref@@ unded by time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with active players in the real world and help many people hunting , more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ er creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Scher@@ r is on all that immune .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast de@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ fight title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; crew adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bal@@ ken during the individual competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts it in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting her last trial in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ bo and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace , having won gold and silver in the retail shelves of women at the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ al took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ are@@ well ceremony of the retired team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark . &quot;
&quot; although making it on the top of its long path to the top , never to have planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained .
&quot; since summer 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even when Must@@ af@@ ina led through two turns , the image fl@@ ared . &quot;
Sul@@ ph@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ it holds the world title title - loud .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 433 in the bri@@ m bar again - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embrac@@ ed her gently as she expected her ending - pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on bil@@ ly sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , than the vision she once described in her collective book , became a reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the Bronze Med@@ al went in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old club@@ team , called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their bottom exercise , she threw the audience of kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for balance , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in the case of series production when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first run @-@ up of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and list@@ ened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator hum@@ bled eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ hau@@ l , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was giving investig@@ ators to a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months and two more in@@ jured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ bo loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
I do not create this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a walk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life .
but it slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please send me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected tick .
pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ds gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ is@@ iana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it is expected the whole Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with extensive floo@@ ds in extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards shared that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the communities concerned .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service revealed that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ is@@ iana , will all probability be reached after the weekend record level . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the localities near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flow over the tro@@ ug@@ h rivers only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ et@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still used people from floo@@ ding in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved in the proximity of Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step @-@ son , who lives near , warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flows and flows in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were staying until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds were spreading rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities hes@@ it@@ ated evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was completely su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and educational events in five school districts .
&quot; the WW@@ L , the C@@ BS subsidiary reported that in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , 200 floo@@ ded houses attacked . &quot;
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were now both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the ruler of the assembly Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ations were arranged to accommodate the evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take care that hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy LAN@@ DR@@ UM from municipal administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Co@@ unt@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no reported . &quot;
&quot; Kei@@ th Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; extingu@@ ished by spheres &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves fir@@ ing in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police inform@@ s that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several guns , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it simply .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investig@@ ating just whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could be .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge tubes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wn the Tat@@ ort . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuous struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sockets . &quot;
&quot; thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; divided police por@@ man Anthony G@@ inal@@ di police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police report@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross bat on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspiring many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ism , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ ast women was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this indicates strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejo@@ iced . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion@@ ships Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected un@@ expect@@ edly , but master@@ ly gymn@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won an individual competition event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won Silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not look like sports classes across the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all struck the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic partnership will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks so that Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ ast in the first place in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents supporting the training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued inde@@ fin@@ itely . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the churches au@@ n countless young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ astic institution for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urb@@ ane young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians would like to organise further strikes after rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance physicians who voted in a choice rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt plans un@@ vei@@ led the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; and would be dam@@ aging any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work , in order to improve the care of early hours . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assist@@ ants shared the last night in a message with &quot; &quot; Assi@@ stance physicians have made serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current crisis and admini@@ ster it to meet all the doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA for resol@@ ving disputes by the government on the account of the government to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened in a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to raise the condition and address the car@@ es of the assistant physicians .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaign measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post envel@@ ope . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly compensation for the 54@@ .000 Assi@@ stance physicians , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assist@@ ants to finish the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything of the only little but already stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare the patient , par@@ ishes and their families only wor@@ ries , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assist@@ ants and responded positively to the health ministry and other mini@@ stries in a positive response to the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers expected that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , additional training for those who return from a professional apprenticeship , training camps , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is ad@@ ministered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form cover@@ ings .
&quot; if the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots release , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft release of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation by Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all , the risk of ble@@ eding - is limited to a period of up to three years . &quot;
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , el@@ ective observ@@ ations and town halls to ignore the pro@@ ofs of elect@@ oral mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an anti @-@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elect@@ oral channels in order to protect vali@@ dated vot@@ ers . &quot;
he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a reference to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable inks on the finger of a person when they release their elect@@ oral vote to prevent someone el@@ ects twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only aimed at elect@@ oral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year a Special Court decided that the veter@@ in@@ arian mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be revealed after a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have conducted his campaign on the basis , that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in the el@@ der members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elect@@ oral system , including the guide of instruc@@ tors to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been ex@@ erted , especially women and young people in order to choose in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behaviour based on &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist papers will work to stop &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tou@@ g@@ her registration checks , in order to avoid that the elect@@ oral directory is used for immigration and social @-@ bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable inks on the finger of a person once she gave her voice to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
systematic review on the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic post@@ age .
prohibition that political activists deal with full brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letters .
&quot; the police give the authority , set up barriers to set up election stations . &quot;
a amend@@ ment made for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation pursuant to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Ord@@ in@@ ance Law 1983 ) .
photographer ban in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training in order to ensure that employees rule the rule that vot@@ ers go alone in the elect@@ oral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the El@@ ection Court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ ght , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; shut @-@ off control &quot; of the scri@@ bes of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country we@@ ars a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden propag@@ ation of el@@ ective fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger von Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are out of the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of the border and band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in der Herz@@ og@@ in of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to compete with Gold , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio and all the famous faces , which fli@@ rt on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous sites . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycle track , many people on the Internet point out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin pack of a @-@ pro@@ mi Leonardo da Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; Br@@ ady told Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I miss it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is to pass through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swim@@ mer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one ais@@ le higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption ac@@ tress
&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nicely , who is similar to heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair as ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football @-@ star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the space : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the Sim@@ il@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who resem@@ bles her very beautiful , wide smile that resem@@ bles Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; comm@@ ent@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ estyle ring . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ators team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; color &quot; , &quot; could hear : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came swi@@ ft@@ ly and hard in which many presented him
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how un@@ aware B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; W@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ected .
&quot; short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the commentary @-@ mate Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we regret it sin@@ cere that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it was broad@@ cast@@ ed .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audi@@ ences and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortun@@ ate formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s cri@@ mp in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are indig@@ nant over woman who tried sham@@ eless@@ ly under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to sample sub@@ s . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered as she looked in it , pulled her out and laid her back to the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place m@@ all in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried to wear under@@ wear , she went up and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the show@@ room standing , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ings and pants and tast@@ ed them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t fall back and went out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching anyone - or thinking about the person , who would under certain circumstances buy the under@@ pants which she had tast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson said , &quot; As I got along , the staff tried to pull the garments off the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of leder@@ h@@ osen and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t get washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in fol@@ k@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him down with his knees and twist , while the aggres@@ sor mani@@ f@@ ests in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as she dire@@ cts the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and direct the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; posts : 3,@@ 207 &quot;
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .

Rei@@ sender Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ fish of a serious test by hiding some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and Reise@@ aut@@ or Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted his course on a Euro Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing cr@@ adle of a ten@@ sile toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us on what it is going to happen . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of det@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing button on a toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing he hid , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing p@@ ans of toilets , the task posed its immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was meeting his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ pane showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to hide after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
&quot; I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass gave us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in bow@@ el health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the movie director , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had spar@@ ked some of the things I told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to put Ian on them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film .
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they should at least occasionally use products that contain attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
&quot; social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an A@@ social family left her social housing after a delay with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were removed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed cl@@ inging holes , wooden panels were ri@@ pped , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she fears that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property might be considered as not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and its reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all r@@ ack@@ ets , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive sh@@ outing , bus@@ hes and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tr@@ aded in the past , the wooden boards were up@@ set &quot;
neighbours saying that they saw them fighting on the street and regular police had to be inv@@ oked regularly
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ tied her and her partner this week by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ inqu@@ ents were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They h@@ ated no one . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have ad@@ ministered the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the shel@@ tered side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ ministered to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ inqu@@ ation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be aw@@ ful .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have bold@@ ly appro@@ ached us and have provided the information to us . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine penalty after acqu@@ iring possession of a drug of class B in trading view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don which came to life in 2013 .
after they were without shelter it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many exterior walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ ise ren@@ ters who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared with a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

dramatic video foot@@ age showed how the military aircraft fle@@ w nearly in tan@@ gible proximity to the sun @-@ wor@@ shi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the tourists jump@@ ed up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the no@@ zzles , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it fle@@ w very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;

the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats from the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet , due to the poor visibility of the area , fle@@ w slightly lower than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira island came to death . &quot;

&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; even at 3 : 2 in the first stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing . &quot;

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sent@@ ences and in time outs , they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they had pulled back onto the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequently . &quot;
after the game were gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .

Donald Tr@@ ump leaves ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states , to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire exc@@ elled as something as concerns were reported as correspon@@ dents .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have violent trou@@ bles in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ ook again . &quot;
Republi@@ can high@@ bur@@ gers
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equ@@ alled by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes anticip@@ ate Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the sender &apos;s CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop the adv@@ ancement of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him for the sake of political correctness , that is right , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened to strike money to support his elect@@ oral campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
instead of wanting the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for the congress are more powerful than the arms .
Olympic : thir@@ ster fraud at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ mach site .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee dealt with promp@@ tly to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official said that the former spr@@ inter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich in the Olympic village . &quot;
this was reported to Kenya &apos;s team leader from dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has set the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to strain his own investigation , shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the outcome of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and signed up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in Beijing World Cup .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Committee Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted by the Rio games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing societies for a longer period of time .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the visa . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exercis@@ ed a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia commen@@ cement .
&quot; in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ form with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this way , it was demonstrated that in this sport area was widespread and systematically Ged@@ opt . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival highlights the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable amateur couple , like Romeo and Juliet . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classical and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and melo@@ dy .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix of the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ ol@@ y her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is therefore clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conductor is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and today they are as meaningful as at that time . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , IT@@ V news reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family &apos;s information shortly after she pre@@ ten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ bom@@ bed country , and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with getting into a war zone - people from holding this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from east London got into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ anas &apos;s family was told that she married a IS@@ IS f@@ ighter in Syria - and within a few months she became wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of a election win at Gar@@ land &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land to judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor to Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court judge .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d said later that he had@@ n &apos;t spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised the Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia .

I do that for women .
apparently it is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic n@@ eck@@ fulness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not adapt and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a short term with ten thousand protective seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the President of the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh prec@@ ession of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime comb@@ ats minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already covered Kur@@ dish high@@ ways with criminal actions three months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , there are still sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks . &quot;
many will want to start new in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself absor@@ bs refugees , produced refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Association compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the transfer pressure to the remaining cur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been er@@ adi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the President demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; takes place against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ osi@@ tion@@ elle . &quot;

&quot; like the newspaper referred to figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Tur@@ ks already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on 30 June , this was 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all known as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no fear of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; grounds for asylum according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country &apos;s choice will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for it is not stup@@ id than to date : summer holidays , heat , and land combat - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced of the campaign@@ ers , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : during holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ating air bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end voices , only lab@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over to the people shortly before the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just started . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in question clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; what is exciting is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive elect@@ oral campaign , one sees from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through land , distri@@ butes ros@@ es and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering got cold feet and is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel &apos;s gu@@ ilt at the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , her &quot; We create the &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to make major discoveries ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary circuit is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely reno@@ un@@ ces the usual election campaigns on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that is , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that , on the country , it br@@ ils down on the ground that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is about the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the widths of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign@@ ers Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ declar@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is in the game , Sell@@ ering called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in surveys , should make the leap into the land@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the vac@@ ations , and largely dis@@ close their campaign into the internet . &quot;
&quot; online elect@@ oral campaign , &quot; he calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green suff@@ ers embar@@ k on track search for local stim@@ ul@@ ants among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ens with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : Gast@@ stätten suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to compl@@ ain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilit@@ ated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work that begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only finish at 8@@ pm , there is praise everywhere . &quot;
&quot; they did everything quite cris@@ p , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff says of the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; at the beginning of the day , the building site was able to move to the south as planned , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen , and there@@ with the connection to Rot@@ tenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were partially considerable complaints , &quot; says the dep@@ uty head manager Florian King responsible for the traffic @-@ related management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ gar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ev@@ ils were looking for and more trusted to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as also the speed limits were not met , the municipality rein@@ forces the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est way was with 77 kilometres kilometers in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again . &quot;
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to sales in@@ cub@@ ators , everybody asks you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; only slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also states that of course &quot; &quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis is missing . &quot;
the most frequently exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; , &quot; he rec@@ alled sales revenue . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; road marking has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismis@@ sed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 staff and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the note answered , the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have to bear the dis@@ advantages arising from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled . &quot;
&quot; with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure his host will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less frequent because of the complicated road performance , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that its stem @-@ climate returns to the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with B@@ SE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of counter @-@ counter to laws .
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a large security package . &quot;
but what does it have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new safety package . &quot;
they don &apos;t ask anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I participate . &quot;
&quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , however , it was due to results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; within the Co@@ alition . &quot;
&quot; according to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time hiding before he presents his conclusions on security in the republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already been announced , announced , that a new security agency will take care of encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under punishment and cr@@ ack ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still ret@@ ains it for reasonable and doesn &apos;t require anything , which is not a chance at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas will be presented at Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid proceedings for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
refugees that are specifically brought into the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of cancellation for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally cur@@ ated .
man@@ ches also works un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally and leaves questions frank@@ ly .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; in the face of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people deeply concerned , could not be sp@@ las@@ hed out even in elect@@ oral campaign periods . &quot;
the inner safety is enor@@ mously concentrated in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are increasingly moving into position on the topic of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it went high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ chy quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Gover@@ nor also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also we@@ ary here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double @-@ pass , he &apos;s nothing . &quot;
we have negoti@@ ated the discussion in Germany .
you can re@@ mark it unless reasonable .
&quot; and in a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; is for the co @-@ contracting partner , must first show itself . &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ position itself on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; partner Sig@@ mar Gabriel notes cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still moving lightly .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising all over the world . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs smoothly .
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year in the deliveries of deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car can forward a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the brand was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe , and thus res@@ um@@ ed the whole sale , as indicated in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the we@@ aker figures out of July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has given a &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation relating to Turkey &apos;s attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote for the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas sector first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus for be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected family stamp of the Lower Saxony is further gli@@ ding by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is now available . &quot;
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler demonstrated a sales platform from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated de@@ gas tests with a software .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to equi@@ p the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not show any deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the motorway toll@@ s the customers after the conversion a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t talk about a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in company circles . &quot;
the reason is legal fin@@ es .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen now acqu@@ ires its German customers a guarantee for res@@ ili@@ ent diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed by the Austrian Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the ministry of transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA fully respon@@ sive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Ministry of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW took over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance did not take place after the conversion and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen is able to provide customers for example half a year after conversion , for example , with engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that any damage that has nothing to do with the waste @-@ sc@@ andal has resulted in uncertainty regarding possible warranty rules , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from weal@@ thy spar@@ ers in future trials - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; ordinary austerity &quot; &quot; would not have to be afraid of paying for its austerity policies . &quot;
&quot; if banks shift money overnight at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent sentence . &quot;
&quot; this fee calls for the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gyp@@ sum or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he had 40 million Euros for a long time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; said the bank boss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs are now passed on after the poll@@ uter pays principle .
&quot; leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank &apos;s v@@ aul@@ ts would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already seen four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern said : &quot; &quot; the EC@@ B &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry you alone , &quot; &quot; economically sustainable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their charges for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ al- and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive of the Banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay nation@@ wide emp@@ t@@ ying for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they bew@@ are for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently , no other banks are known to the co @-@ operative association Bayern , which comp@@ ute a compensation for private customers &apos; deposits , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had said at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who is buying records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ enting to the comment section , to over@@ see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ al@@ ley men &apos;s medi@@ ator with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the prolifer@@ ation of sound plates is not attribut@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but can be attributed to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able buyer . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I run in the midst of a bu@@ st@@ ling street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and let go wild before I stop , hold my hands and define something like this : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart Soh@@ o slowly bu@@ ys in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialist stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men middle ages ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason he owns such a siz@@ able number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford than they appeared and bought objects he sold when he was young and clever .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I presum@@ ably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are causing them to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of parti@@ tions of the record re@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans are feeling overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to pull back to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that w@@ rest@@ le happ@@ ier jubil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; We@@ z says . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it &apos;s the case with many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to engage in spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; sol@@ dered an employee of a stack stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , have not yet stopped . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I bl@@ ended up through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova &apos;s comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Record so that I can put them into a shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produ@@ kt@@ ble , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly rein@@ force . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has devoted the sound@@ board almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest synthesis of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ ually thr@@ illing pop in place of the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks particularly lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window shopping spre@@ ader than a big shopping basket .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to b@@ ump my pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ agers looking for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and sending some customers to the bottom Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collector &apos;s and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the bum@@ ble@@ be@@ es through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who out@@ rag@@ ed over the shoulders of nothing of middle aged men . &quot;

French court ref@@ utes offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of stores in the jungle of refugee camps
&quot; a French dish has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be able to sell 72 pro@@ visional businesses , in which people sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes are paid and which are a fire and security risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the dish that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups cannot offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the pro@@ visional businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people conducting the 72 pro@@ visional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the low @-@ price was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in char@@ itable and offering 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the peti@@ tion to keep the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure was &quot; &quot; for these children of a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; said Martin . &quot;

here comes the rein@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , the Tem@@ po@@ ün@@ der should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the future @-@ proof en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used on accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary wind heater for maintaining the speed limit@@ er . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanently mobile construction can be too dangerous or co@@ stly . &quot;
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement . the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and pass @-@ through prohi@@ bitions according to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
&quot; so that it is not simply stolen , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear in a safe outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash@@ ing with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
Britain gets Silver in 7 @-@ er Rugby after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by arrived at the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a class class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they defeated New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have sm@@ ashed a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not mean that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ously and let the attacks of the GB@@ s jump@@ ed out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. on , as if you were going into driving co@@ aches . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ se@@ w Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was r@@ aging in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly caught the ball .
&quot; a tough cry from Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ ander@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ i@@ ded through further weak bl@@ ackl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to pause .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK is still pi@@ red . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB brought fundamental changes to the half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ yan gap ... for the whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ s@@ aner , whose fans sang , scor@@ ing flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff t@@ inted that Fi@@ j@@ is embrac@@ ed himself and GB sk@@ ill@@ fully sm@@ ashed in the law@@ ns .
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan was defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown pushed the bu@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scor@@ ed a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late T@@ ackl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
&quot; there will be no emotional gold than with these games , and that &apos;s what I want . &quot;
&quot; from the first rowing stroke to the last , 220 severe p@@ ieve which enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio de Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if they were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they prevented the first women in the history of British sport , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 39.@@ 8 un@@ protected use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would make the difference and no one was more moved than the coach , who would not survive this day before he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the right term at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ ri@@ cher morning with doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an effort in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be ri@@ pped .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exempl@@ ary for clarity provided for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was time ago in the original tone in a paper of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Franconia would have been hon@@ oured to the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , was 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the pot@@ able water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Broad@@ brunn , promotes approx . 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brunn mayor Gertru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rem@@ inded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they expanded from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget schedul@@ ing , calculation of fees and contributions to weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , it called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , landed property in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the parts of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always added new additions , because water and drinking water were the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate @-@ lowering in front of the Upper Franconia Regional Forum . &quot;
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller first praised Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ cher and he was a faithful member .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ construction and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , were the pi@@ ping at the Hoch@@ container near Kirch@@ heim on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the board of directors of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed she must die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well advanced and now learn privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot;

relationship Consult@@ ant in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots on partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and wounded them mort@@ ally .
&quot; the man called upon us and stated to have shot his partner &apos;s wife , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , after him I was publicly pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
it is however a few years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information on the wai@@ st@@ line or the relationship between the perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; but they confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a child of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a special operation mand@@ o ( SEK ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Vision for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ driven German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens arising from the sector of green electricity are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers , the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when generators in the steel works are replaced by an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own production .
&quot; with this , the status qu@@ o of the previous scheme is largely fixed . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China cast masses of steel to the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers are presenting Chinese steel @-@ conc@@ erted price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import tari@@ ffs are imposed on import steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bright@@ ened up . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price repeti@@ tion is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have rather stag@@ gered . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reduc@@ tions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclu@@ de closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the same period of the previous year , as the Steel Industry announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now went back to the second month of the row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors Choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ackl@@ er says of the German senior le@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; most senior singers sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , writes H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
because the sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly calls his lungs , does not get so quickly out of the powder in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs awak@@ ens a lot of memories in elderly people , often associated with positive feelings of her youth time . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people with demen@@ tia dis@@ like for long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a special achievement is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogni@@ tive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people , who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one experiences through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I prac@@ tise for a long time , I become better and aw@@ ake beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes beside her ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors offer different possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ sel@@ or &apos;s choir , one can simply join himself . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neigh@@ bors to help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than k@@ ater on the k@@ itt@@ ens of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover the effect of calling cat litter on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the Mi@@ bit also didn &apos;t leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mar@@ sh of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens from k@@ itt@@ ens who found themselves in great dist@@ ress as scientists found out from the veterinary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the les@@ see of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams are different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a herd of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger reb@@ elled k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned out faster to the loudspeaker , when he played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ mental to the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; by Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , Turkey will again take place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected . &quot;
but this does not apply to those susp@@ ected to belong to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len whom one is responsible for the attempted coup .
&quot; in the process , even before football is not done . &quot;
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the South of America living in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ ür should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup d &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; although the state of exception has been suspended for 90 days until October , indeed this has no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ gans .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not belong to the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the growth of the Tur@@ ks is the strict ref@@ usal of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; with Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; it will be especially welcome to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Köl@@ ner presented his sporting value in the past season : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scor@@ ed the 1 : 0 winner . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; after the bonus @-@ kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also show up early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , there was only to sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we managed and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ reff@@ ern as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ en@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , at the signing of AC Florence , he had only announced his bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez to the coup attempt to return to the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around a third of its estimated volume of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his sal@@ ary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals odds at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others covered Athle@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock shortly before the games , was ple@@ aded out mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) and bu@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; there was a hur@@ ry scene : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her performance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who in spite of dop@@ ing past go to the start at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion , even faster than before , is the number one in the world more than 100 m in 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times World Champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after having been det@@ ectable by the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , I had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 World Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion in 2010 to 2016 have positively tested Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic suffered the conc@@ ert@@ ory intake and was closed for six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible and dr@@ aped Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( ham@@ mer@@ ed , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete were subsequently recognized as many medals . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having been found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 EM @-@ title because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
the also recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games returned to CAS due to a jud@@ gement of the International Criminal Court CAS .
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the World rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 year old World Championship , references to taking a b@@ anned dietary supplement found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran off on 13th July . &quot;
terror bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ jured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the foreign ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; I have suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded by two bom@@ bs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ Tah@@ in were killed and about 20 people were wounded , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday early , two spr@@ ints went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bom@@ b explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was in@@ jured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bom@@ b explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal representative . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air before the prec@@ inct of the territ@@ orial police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were called on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern , typical of the bom@@ b attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ istic u@@ prising movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have been able to receive sec@@ rec@@ y references to forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country , but they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
&quot; still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police showed their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security related to major government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ bs , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confront@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday accepted a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum held by the military j@@ unt@@ a .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
&quot; j@@ unt@@ a leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bom@@ bs had been an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos , while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloo@@ dy un@@ rest , keeps herself confident of having led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago in Bangkok were killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Right &quot; &quot; Identity Movement &quot; &quot; is in the opinion of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several Landes@@ äm@@ ders , the constitutional provisions in the Con@@ federation have also provided the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; Identity Movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Ms Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen , the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identity Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ as said , his authority was closely aligned with the authorities in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identity Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Council . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists are just like right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; he said , he has no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aten , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be legal prot@@ rac@@ ist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal entities or small groups form , plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nation@@ wide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodations were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed previously with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the easily over@@ weight swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a resign@@ ation of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the International Swimming Association .
this is distributed to make swimming in subordin@@ ated countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since in eth@@ ia most athletes walk , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of the swimming pool from equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not look so close to the im@@ min@@ ent suff@@ rage
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the choice to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an altern@@ ate vide@@ o@@ grapher . &quot;
he then drive on holiday .
&quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a phone interview with the US television station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him for the sake of political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus he described the US President Barack Obama and the nom@@ in@@ ee of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
mail enters the trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electric vehicle transpor@@ ters from the coming year even on the free car market .
&quot; we want to get into sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company checks whether they are delivered to their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets to sell to other businesses . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Board Jürgen Ger@@ des had said , there are always inquiries , such as crafts@@ men . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter the mass production of vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ own factory , the company plan to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we would change the whole fleet .

GR@@ P leadership occurs after dis@@ appoint@@ ing business figures
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the in@@ cis@@ ions suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed the chair of leader Matthias Hartmann to be even more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after re @-@ dis@@ appoint@@ ing business figures and the resign@@ ation of the company management the world @-@ wide number five of the industry is faced with a personal new start .
GR@@ P Executive Board intends to leave the company for the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
&quot; the management in the management board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as of September 1 , informed the company . &quot;
&quot; he is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hartmann . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the resign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details would not want to mention a spokes@@ man on Friday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K leader@@ board since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after five years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually un@@ settle at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , this would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable figure of the previous year . &quot;
sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent to the first half @-@ year .
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , has stressed the un@@ interrupted value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
the consolidated sales de@@ preci@@ ation of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division secured a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the line .
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; in an accident of a travel bus with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were in@@ jured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to depart from an opposite truck , which drove partly on the co@@ aster . &quot;
the bus arrived right off the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire @-@ bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ance ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene 2 .
the in@@ jured travellers were transferred from a regular bus to Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ ewater will be from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World donation 3,@@ 44 instead of before 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased again at the latest , if appropriate improvements are needed . &quot;
&quot; after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will lie at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the land@@ r@@ ats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach was appro@@ ached by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach land@@ mark office that for these wast@@ ewater facilities under@@ took shelter . &quot;
the market Kas@@ dorf is obliged due to legal basis to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to access deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the rate increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director , Herbert Schmidt presented the Board , a new calculation of fees for the wast@@ ewater treatment of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and over@@ l@@ app@@ ings from the previous period of calculation are to be compens@@ ated . &quot;
Schmidt founded the serious b@@ unker increases in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenditure , in the past period of the period not least due to the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ ez almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater plant .
&quot; in the Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl pump station , the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and in the pond water plant Lop@@ p had to operate the first slu@@ dge after almost 20 years , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed , and an additional ventilation system could be installed in order to maintain the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses were the continued maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the previous year 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the low wast@@ ewater case in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully beat .
&quot; moreover , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in wast@@ ewater facilities has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous in the view of stone houses on the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal waste @-@ purpose association is not to be extended by these facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first to zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the rate of inflation since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cart@@ oon cri@@ tici@@ zes
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is an anim@@ ator , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , it allows Snap@@ chat around 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ d . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , stand @-@ alone twi@@ sting tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all the mis@@ carri@@ ages go to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in which they have been accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or propag@@ ating white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cart@@ oon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought to be an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter rem@@ inded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely distributed over the photos , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and blind &quot; said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian cart@@ oon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not pun@@ ish@@ able , but that the yellow face was drawn into the wi@@ dening extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people , who are different in race as their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that &quot; &quot; raci@@ al contex@@ ts &quot; &quot; reflects a lack of diversity among sett@@ ling practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership and ended up her essay with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company publ@@ ishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer who focused on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said , in turn , that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership w@@ asted IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ based information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions allowed on the ground , reported an examination board of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Ar@@ med Forces of Ar@@ med Forces , Secret Services Committee , and the Defence Committee , reported how su@@ peri@@ ors changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ jud@@ ging information typically disp@@ at@@ ched by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , reported a positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions allowed on site and were consistently positive as the analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guiding errors in the Cent@@ Com range from the top point of the organization .
the report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Ira@@ qi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military recon@@ quest Mos@@ sul could start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the head of the Central Command changed the intelligence agencies to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans called Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ Com reports are reported by the General Insp@@ ector of the Defense Department . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of resp@@ ectable services to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; the Supreme Commander of the Committee of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence @-@ related reports , &quot; pre@@ ached mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; gave excessive amounts of space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General Insp@@ ector of the Pentagon , who were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the general insp@@ ections were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversi@@ al debate on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation has also made conclusions about the issue of a successful Air Camp@@ a@@ ign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the intelligence information about the Islamic state remind of customs of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , considered just a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker to address government agencies that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , this pro@@ visional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s of the former Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Leg@@ isl@@ ative because of his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US gains fourth match in women &apos;s hock@@ ey , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field hock@@ ey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a worthy performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; but that knows , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ins on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer out of the path that will lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising twi@@ sting through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hock@@ ey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to make things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work bench in London that we now have .
we have ru@@ ined the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash out of the se@@ am area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k and then moved into the middle and led the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ vari@@ ably , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it &apos;s like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast .
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a ladies black with dimples , could certainly have been among those known names that were sent to Prime Time , based on sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising when he was a swim@@ mer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should be modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so spar@@ sely noticed that many people , I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that there is even an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had made an ath@@ l@@ ete to the final round of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadian women for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlight@@ ened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school than for the Olympic games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an enlight@@ ened enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact , but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging champ@@ ions jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must end up a series of falling movements ( turning , h@@ itting and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to the execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the projection screen , but also another pol@@ ish@@ able goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ or@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a breathing space .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she jump@@ ed off , seemingly weight@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and end @-@ hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; which of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
&quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ rounds as part of a weekday , on both days from 14.00 onwards . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ see in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by att@@ aching and obj@@ ectivity of male ath@@ lets - as the male US gymn@@ asts proposed recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air from flying to air , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses testi@@ fy that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government shake the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen shot and killed on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this land and in the future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repres@@ sion by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , while dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks off , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a broad election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversi@@ al line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been imposed more or less in recent years , could use turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiopia had been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians att@@ ained that they were so called protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mostly come to Christian high countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ tic@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that are dominant around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , had until his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special appoint@@ ees to process opponents and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ interrupted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , which apparently ple@@ d@@ ged from the government according to analysts and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of ri@@ ots went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian town , conducted by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests brought the U.S. and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for can@@ on flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally coll@@ ap@@ sing in an already vol@@ ati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ asp@@ ing . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es that Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that sur@@ rounds his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State &apos;s terrorist group , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates on whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants , who endeav@@ our to take refuge during an event@@ ful period , into the peculi@@ ar position of declar@@ ing declar@@ ations which he could not mean . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump went back to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the exc@@ use completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by rem@@ inding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ eches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again on Friday .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bor@@ ed . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said that the Russi@@ ans were supposed to ch@@ op Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he later said , Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then rel@@ inqu@@ ish it as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive and if necessary , &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , I believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of bl@@ ur@@ ring the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump assumed an even more dig@@ ni@@ fied sound since its survey results have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with great advantage in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally temp@@ ted to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor wrong . &quot;
&quot; but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his lo@@ y@@ alist com@@ rades in the un@@ comfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was ques@@ tioned to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps claims whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense it is true that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization he called them &quot; &quot; Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler &quot; , &quot; completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainst@@ ream Republi@@ cans are attemp@@ ting to argue that the government under Obama , in Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of guiding them on each of his words and taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ umps inno@@ c@@ ence than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once the price of the market is ou@@ sted , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was an am@@ big@@ uous café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , but had served a good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , it is also new creation . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside state , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lights from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment as well .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted onions .
there are tears of nature .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb concluded , she gave a while the coffee fever , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there before the work , and in@@ vari@@ ably kept the same . &quot;
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , that he did not take a gru@@ dge over the fact that the soap business took the old business room . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bo@@ asted coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit her soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb extends to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated del@@ ights of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ schil@@ d@@ br@@ oth soup . &quot;
&quot; the menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ orian .
&quot; recently book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they show culinary solidarity as they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter asked Hack@@ br@@ aten , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ anu@@ ts , g@@ inger@@ bread and sav@@ ory bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that the ingredient is stretched .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ anu@@ ts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ in@@ gest .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; men of women bo@@ iled for male fel@@ ine and it was served freshly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; stands out the ways with which the country went around to no longer be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ amed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se as the new bud@@ dy : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and k@@ asser@@ s were stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , since ch@@ efs could hide un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rar@@ ity of a rar@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ es were tried out , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also contains recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a favorite addi@@ tive at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated fiscal policy - including Louise Stan@@ ley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country in such a way . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ ampe as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake food @-@ post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he fed up as the milli@@ on@@ ary man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked a continental breakfast like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wor@@ e a smo@@ king .
he was terri@@ fic to reality .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ ute a temple with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the c@@ aste of a house@@ keeper led to no interest in tastes by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most tro@@ dden . &quot;
many of the species from the age of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back on the legs .
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law better - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the sei@@ z@@ ure of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert made at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a tri@@ cky trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ spro@@ ved somewhat rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few min@@ ced wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bom@@ b attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group that previously saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers place their own lives in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guards , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a dog from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the hor@@ rors of war .
&quot; however , as a hero he has never seen himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ op@@ ters have dropped four barrels over the Alz@@ adia bor@@ ough , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bom@@ b lest children play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to hit terr@@ orists .
Grön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ ral animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic until today .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie received offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; on average , Greenland is swi@@ ft@@ ly swi@@ ft@@ ly on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal speeds up 2.6 km / h , and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this , characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least one of Greenland , who could be 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an which represents a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist believed long that Grön@@ land ha@@ ie became stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , and finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin sealed co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only dip in the surface in winter . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ dingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks .
their time @-@ motion @-@ p@@ um@@ o measures it when they out@@ lined up six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
&quot; nevertheless , the loo@@ t makes these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ic@@ eberg and look for cad@@ avers that tor@@ ate from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks who were catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the greatest 502 cm was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens already appears before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; therefore , your birth should be after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons search large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon tow into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the lens core contained a slight over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons in which with 220 cm centimet@@ ers , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all the larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ ers , which result in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cen@@ timeter long , while the record shar@@ k might be 392 years old with 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Greenland only then got offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland shar@@ ks obviously span at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land @-@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon tip , was im@@ pris@@ oned in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age s@@ lower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building plot in double pack
&quot; with topics around construction , the Municipal Council has focused primarily on the recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the newly reported living areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fying the plots , par@@ zel@@ lier@@ - and settlement questions and the applications for survey@@ ing could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to prosp@@ ective buyers nothing more in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Scho@@ au young families and anno@@ ying elderly alike appeal .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lige now can contact the town hall immediately , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to consult in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to include requests for the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area is already expanded by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the City of the Main has the best opportunities to shift jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether investors should continue to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient to grant them approval in the UK . &quot;
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , is responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance coverage of E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ RB . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , it cuts as much as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city has easy access to commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer the city stands on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers . &quot;
&quot; the relations of forces also speak : in London , according to figures by the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead gets legal costs from the h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. minister decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the Pharmaceu@@ tical Company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs of S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead faced a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Mr Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to exemp@@ t the costs incur@@ red during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ be@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the US supported troops reg@@ ained full control of the northern town of Man@@ o@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) com@@ prise the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civilians , which were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of Reu@@ ters alli@@ ed with the D@@ CS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean@@ ers through , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons Ear@@ ls 10.@@ 75 Million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about their office hours in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ pers Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ tors with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated the reason for his ref@@ usal to control tax audi@@ ts by tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ pers Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N , that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax insp@@ ections are not finished . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already clari@@ fied that his ref@@ usal to raise issues relating to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business models and various other connections , particularly with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown itself on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks for its tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , declar@@ ing that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat , tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination of IR@@ S , and Tr@@ ump did &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before elect@@ ors and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return by the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 tax return showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons contributed divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 109@@ ,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Elef@@ ant protection
conservation in Tanzania uses an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ders .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and harv@@ ests , without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a world calling day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps involve the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bu@@ b@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; the chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is fil@@ med up to the ignition thread . &quot;
when it is lit the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a bang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des into the air .
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots up a fire fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;
Stad@@ stood un@@ anim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk with the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment plans of tr@@ ades@@ people with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and take place - the retail trade in the core city is regarded as clearly evident . &quot;
&quot; however , the city council now bor@@ row@@ ed the application for the new construction of a sales ski@@ os@@ ks near the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons under construction . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new tr@@ ades@@ people , but at this location in an ex@@ pon@@ ed location on the Rhine shore , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director defe@@ ats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre@@ fix , as there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Brist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel about its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him &quot; , &quot; as wrote Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre @-@ selection is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; Lanz@@ mann was c@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and pl@@ ung@@ ed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a pretty big response on the internet , in which people knew the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged demands of Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; fo@@ aming you , &quot; said it in another post that was pointed out that the hotel situated at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all acc@@ us@@ ations of itself and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel did not enter into the election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber floors against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday , when they assembled to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber floors against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer , tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to Gum@@ mis@@ ses and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their dism@@ ay over the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the State State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the pro@@ visional President Michel Tem@@ er at walls spra@@ ying .
&quot; the most recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators stepped on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been enth@@ r@@ alled by a vote of the Senate on their dismis@@ sal from the ministry . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading turnover between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the year of the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest of Russian businesses in the country grew shar@@ ply , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are willing to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trading turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade show has been reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation was around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot;
searched for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl over@@ fall
a rob@@ ber@@ y case has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the provision of a fire@@ arm , three dark cloth@@ ed persons challeng@@ ed their faces , from the staff of the beverage market forced the release of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police did not divide . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have been large between 1,60 and 1,70 m , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly accessible .
&quot; the perpet@@ rat@@ ors must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the Sch@@ ot@@ ter@@ park@@ platz with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
anyone who has made observ@@ ations in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should strongly notify the police .
Nag@@ old : fun games and fun
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young@@ sters of the social ped@@ ago@@ gic daily group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers on their summer frei@@ zeit in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet village of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was lod@@ ged during the first school of school . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to Bret@@ ten by visiting the zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bronn , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group fell on the Tief@@ en@@ see in Maul@@ bronn , who invited for jumping , swimming and pl@@ anting . &quot;
&quot; children and super@@ vis@@ ors with their own appe@@ tiz@@ ers , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful jewels made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman Mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voy@@ age , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gateway of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ ach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ pilgrimage of all ministers in probably two years , the top @-@ minist@@ erial tour of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage to pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bisch@@ of@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy was a special pilgrimage destination for this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and informed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; from H@@ orb , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er Lieben Frau stands and so the pilgri@@ m took place from the Mu@@ enster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is made on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again in order to sing together a song of specially created pilgrims song book . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish priests of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller provided a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of route , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lo@@ wered and then again climb@@ ed . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint bar@@ be@@ cu@@ ing at the lake in the evening .
after the morning pulse at the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ is later in the afternoon and crossed the gateway of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse we were thank@@ ful here .
&quot; in the evening fair in Münster , the Min@@ is of co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed by the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back by train to H@@ orb .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , as Br@@ ite won gold for cycling &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner travel@@ ed last night in the Men &apos;s Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ ungsp@@ und made the legend proud when he went home to take a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
&quot; England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y repeated the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they picked up in March at the railway world champion@@ ships in London , despite the resign@@ ation Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a h@@ ind@@ ran@@ ce .
&quot; Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement generated a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y conquered - and Sk@@ inner were competing in the qualification round , but in the standard @-@ hours the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ ds left behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , with the passing in a higher gear , to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell from Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climb@@ ed to the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to give me a name .
we set up a ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page there was notice that after a weak start he fell inten@@ tionally on the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have so badly left with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , seven of ten titles gained in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a prey of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that came from Ho@@ y the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alist contest of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , who won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will definitely focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday he had argu@@ ed with representatives before the qualification , when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s contest , which will continue and termin@@ ated tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archive of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team rel@@ ies on its strong web team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to collect a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in April , Dr@@ amas with@@ drew in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ proposals , as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite soon as if the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which reached the perfect moment its climax , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield ques@@ tion@@ ably
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supplier agreement and thus to lift all delivery contracts as the energy company ran out . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ vention established for 20 years runs in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance effects since the mel@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire production of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , informed that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through mel@@ ting , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; backup deals &quot; , &quot; which will have effect from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared that the value of the contracts has already been written in its annual subscription amoun@@ ting to $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the ability to use the &quot; &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... &quot; &quot; to operate mel@@ ting or do not imp@@ air the power of sm@@ el@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 , a 20 year treaty signed with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still a declaration of why it resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts were in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; kend@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; kend@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , sp@@ lined reality video showing the entire card@@ holder &apos;s family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ conf@@ isc@@ ated action almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cart@@ oon on a broad@@ casting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls in any way . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the output pul@@ ls a large number of adverti@@ sers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ ter 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expect@@ edly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner is described as the &quot; &quot; break@@ through model &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or adol@@ esc@@ ents of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all is true to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like any success . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d cri@@ tici@@ zed and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ ables of the moment . &quot;
&quot; these sen@@ ti@@ ments cooked up again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover . &quot;
&quot; but on the mis@@ sm@@ ut , it seems to pass on the point . &quot;
kend@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jacob@@ s .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably , only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot;
&quot; municipal utilities aver@@ t 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s ex@@ al@@ tions are rejected by the municipal council centres each year , while the industry insi@@ sts on the effects of further cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ ine@@ ations and similar - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the church centres of Que@@ esland , James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Administr@@ ative Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the aboli@@ tion of the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Municipal Centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ mount@@ able and de@@ pressing deb@@ ts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promp@@ tly raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of communities and their customer communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump charged election campaign after workers allegedly attacked
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had a shot @-@ weapon on a staff , while in February they were travelling in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte &apos;s Landes@@ gericht ( Landes@@ gericht ) of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave up to have been waiting for months for the matter to be regulated internally , before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the train , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini ordered in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he had compl@@ ained at the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini confirmed that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip he gave up in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired , to cause damage , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ution only occurs two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , said the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ uss@@ weapon @-@ Ow@@ ners and arms @-@ friends - should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
the campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not be able to control violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires compensation from the campaign to infr@@ in@@ ce the duty of care and Philip due to bodi@@ ly injury and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ umps &quot; &quot; press spokes@@ woman Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ CC@@ B , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer member of the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could gover@@ n much further , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances of continuing the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 35,@@ 6 percent fell to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party just barely stood before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ated to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey report@@ edly stood only 23 percent ( choice 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Represent@@ atives for the first time . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that pir@@ ates would not miss the default in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would now range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone now comes with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; took over 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer fair in Hanover , as an &quot; office in the west bank format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for dam@@ p standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , including by fax , the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , al@@ beit tor@@ tured slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; the prize was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus around 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Handy @-@ Sp@@ arte of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today the market leaders domin@@ ate vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people daily . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
about 1.4 billion devices sold on Samsung and Apple were 555 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telec@@ om industry .
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone has developed an entire industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive break@@ through to the mass market arrived at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a musical player , a telephone and an Internet communication , everything is easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winners &quot; march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the chance to see . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the le@@ gends are now Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , every German woman now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put away the Smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London .
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will be emplo@@ ying 10,000 new jobs alone , creating 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will f@@ ade on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had inj@@ us@@ tice in 2012 and they will be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented wheel@@ chairs in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
London &apos;s London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit , and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software publishers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block@@ age , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display marks on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop @-@ page would change the encoding about his adverti@@ sements in order to make it difficult to detect display marks indicating that part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man from Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ F@@ ight is already in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has left the fight is a strong indication of how high @-@ level indicator has become an indicator of the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ advertisement makes 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has placed it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control of their adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focus on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed su@@ icide sur@@ passing on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police sei@@ ze witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who requested this as well as every witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the highway on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not need to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious of the street .
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ ist -- who had responded to an emergency -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus once lived
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was once again inhabit@@ able . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at the NA@@ SA have developed a model to detect the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could once , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere once exposed to ground @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , inher@@ ited atmosphere and still slowly moving . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but had once enough water and geo@@ graphic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus ex@@ poses its day @-@ size of the Sun almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella , to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously assumed by planets scientists .
&quot; although it was suppos@@ edly inhabit@@ able , the Venus -- over several billion years --@@ exposed to too much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned out of the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their hy@@ dro , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers share the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of hock@@ ey operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to minor co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , this requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the best coach of the le@@ ague during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; North des@@ ee@@ wel@@ ds res@@ ume talks again , put strike out &quot;
&quot; the work struggles for the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all the disputes for a new round of talks are put at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of wr@@ apping the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some day @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its trac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company exist in order to get through the market recovery .
&quot; shell has dismis@@ sed thousands of people and announced plans to impose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alis@@ es its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ a@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation , which by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the ple@@ bei@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars can rot@@ ate in the star cluster at different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the creation of planets . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ bases , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 445 years of light from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster that arose about 125 million years ago reach ad@@ ulthood .
you are turning right now .
&quot; at top rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars run large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massi@@ vely stars turn more slowly than the less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with more stars s@@ lower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all star comes from
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eb@@ all star in best days from base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participant of Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted to the most valuable player in the le@@ ague , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him USD 27 million a year .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will continue to act as consultant and youth coach - in full sal@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 696 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to earn some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics show similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old shouldn &apos;t be accepted in the hall &apos;s hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , his appearance is beyond the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star had been at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , ster@@ o@@ ids have been released . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to a wound in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main susp@@ ect to have received funding for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the le@@ ague might even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days did not run no@@ is@@ eless@@ ly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eb@@ all le@@ gends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress K@@ ate Hudson , sympath@@ y to the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ test , weight@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an er@@ ased athle@@ tic would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese Flo@@ at Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ stak@@ es in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weight@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the cri@@ tically @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to the in@@ tim@@ acy . &quot;
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court CAS veri@@ fied its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final more than 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the Bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have taken part in the runs over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an unbeliev@@ able shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
according to the report it is supposed to act in the forbidden substance to the dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately reported to criticism of the Athle@@ tin word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all weight@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the whole Russian team except for systematic D@@ op@@ ings , but also the nation @-@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming , the previous off@@ ences in China had also caused violent conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I will pass over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confront@@ ation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champion@@ ships for the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; Daten@@ kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress H@@ acker their ran@@ som , &quot;
program@@ mers of black@@ mail users are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies over the past twelve months have been at least once , partly multiple victims of an assass@@ ination with black@@ mail@@ ed software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ranking of rank@@ ings . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the solution level required by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors to be able to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alise their black@@ smith &apos;s software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rat@@ ors discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches specifically for un@@ changing files such as Word@@ - , Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production still stands . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a Ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute by the loss of sick ac@@ utely . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the face of stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have investigated the usage areas and contact with the agents and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices by chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if individuals are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be hard negoti@@ ated and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als to retri@@ eve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; it is likely , however , that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware @-@ Kits were created by installing the malware , providing advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price of $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ smith searches for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set from a criminal and mand@@ ates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per authentic@@ ated computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als end@@ ure sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on how to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is no sufficient threat to successful performance , the offen@@ ders are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price scales , &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage depends on the type of data even higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a Mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; it sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit surface is falling . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles the HR @-@ V is in the storage box .
&quot; not only a trunk of 453 l is available with raised and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like c@@ aul@@ dron and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; the daily consumption is 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested Top version &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the City Emer@@ gency Assistant is part of the security systems ( operates at speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when maneu@@ ver@@ ing many obstacles than &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the long @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tail@@ gate respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and cho@@ ke at demand the speed .
&quot; however , full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and HDMI connectors are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive from 20000 Euro , diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday servic@@ eable car . &quot;
airline is not liable : assault on passenger bridge
the airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ iron during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have been happening everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick leave will only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests demonstrated the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a family had suffered severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their strike . &quot;
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the tourists back to a def@@ ective treatment plant , which allegedly contam@@ inated sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the view that the trip was in@@ adequate - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the se@@ wage plant was indeed def@@ ective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only drove before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his duties , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the rehear@@ s@@ als of water no im@@ pur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belong to the general life @-@ risk .
of 691 guests were only 38 ill @-@ ran@@ ged .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must b@@ ail and decis@@ i@@ vely react to terrorist threats .
sure is : our country will not answer the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not allow this triumph to terr@@ orists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this increases the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympath@@ y for terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is to be re@@ structured as a result of the purchase of weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors should be maintained in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to find solutions how the endanger@@ ing of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister has a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly voted against action .
&quot; that was an ear @-@ eye for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nation@@ ality .
&quot; constitutional Compl@@ aint in the &quot; &quot; M@@ oll@@ ath Case &quot; &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid all that you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green @-@ chief Simone Peter designed the minister to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and act of action .
&quot; the left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a tight@@ ening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ umps on the surrounding street regularly - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the regulation of law should be extended . &quot;
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic at the ambient street every evening in the traffic jam if they drive via the motorway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße , the right track track by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is split early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district council representing Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ ges@@ tion on the fe@@ eder anno@@ ys the drivers especially between 17 and 7 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the needle watch is on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt from a good three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer the required lifting capacity , in order to take two @-@ lane heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated St@@ au will continue , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining period of remaining until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state business consciously chosen the more traffic @-@ we@@ aker time in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;@@ s and the Young Theater now plan a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows you@@ ths with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the young theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 pupils visited the st@@ aging in the Small House between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , the association N@@ ima &apos;@@ s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the Young Theater will be working together within the scope of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of sc@@ iss@@ ors : hope for weather improvement
the weather indicated the star @-@ type Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was poor@@ ly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of stars in the sky . &quot;

relaxing night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening you are rolling around for hours , at night you are aw@@ ake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake of the che@@ que @-@ ring@@ ing anymore to think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders say ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one regards , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ let and sleep disturb@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; especially the passage of passage many people feel un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member in the German Haus@@ ärz@@ ler Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications . &quot;
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake up is frequent above all with depression , &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need one another .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc @-@ disk incident can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and may possibly start to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , We@@ eks has an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should you be with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; those who have not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or drugs - classical sleeping tablets just in exceptional cases , and at most for two weeks - in@@ query . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any practi@@ sed sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems one should first turn to the general practi@@ tioner , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
it can determine whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the sleeping lab , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for the examination in the dor@@ m laboratory , physicians , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing plac@@ ements , in case of dise@@ ased fatigue , in case of sleeping sickness or when one does not find the cause of a sleep disturb@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cl@@ oning , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of pitch screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watching TV for sleeping , stopping drinking alcohol and at night not at the watch - then you start to anticip@@ ate immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swim@@ mer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ appoint@@ ing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a , and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting himself from his ex @-@ team colleagues in the cri@@ tique . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € award and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming sports is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic dop@@ ing or even run it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries too .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Di@@ aries arrested
professional slide at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were able to arrest civilians at the Düsseldorf Police . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and bag ste@@ els as gang .
&quot; at 21 : 30 , civilian civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf met a gang that was known to police officers from last theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ights since mid @-@ July and were passionate , job @-@ oriented and very professional . &quot;
the specialists of the Crime miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can demonstrate the thi@@ eves which have been specially trained for committ@@ ing criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lime trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work at first sight , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a be@@ ol@@ shop . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company , Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a tough action by the police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; when on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede were evacu@@ ated , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the construction workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main organ of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who raised three children here , are mainly gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who wished for majority police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ occup@@ ants and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average rate and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga region . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elect@@ oral lin@@ ers around the world over the past few years : with them , residents from G@@ DR times and former home@@ owners share their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on s@@ worn disks or newly painted fac@@ ades that have been subjected to dy@@ es .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year , together with the words &quot; &quot; centre @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neigh@@ bors who regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body violation , statistics , according to statistics , are reported almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes constitute material damage , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly refurb@@ ished houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant near the controversi@@ al 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is weight@@ y : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that . &quot;
also the famous fire@@ flies do not give it any longer in the Riga region anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal concern , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the residents had to get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly stressed the interpretation of interpretation in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through sight@@ ed new@@ builds in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here rather people live , who are not as good as they are , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot be justified . &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the Hau@@ gans and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who pre@@ fers , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district , poor@@ ly compl@@ aining about noise . &quot;
all persons only with first names have asked to not be named with their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee council
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee council for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , Working Group Assi@@ stance , Administration , Government and who else interfer@@ es with . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicates that hon@@ orary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ice @-@ rich wool @-@ wool , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ous than on the multitude of desired tasks , had meant that the administration wanted to write a job . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for an administrative authority with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an urgent wool mil@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is supporting ven@@ erable and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers soon stand in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
&quot; a serious problem has been , for some time , to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for connecting supp@@ ression .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to does not find the administration of private apartments .
&quot; so far , it does not work , in order to be dependent on private apartments , as a Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the apartments must be not@@ ori@@ ous as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent lead , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help house @-@ masters , do @-@ profit @-@ making work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day need a solid structure , saying Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here for administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it just takes time and it can be brid@@ ged the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work , and be us@@ eless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; however , there is also a problem , the customer says hon@@ estly , &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always too motivated to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all that is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk and does not want to exclu@@ de them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers were sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these inci@@ dents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put them in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to provide hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already able to integrate the previous people at a reasonable price .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for a helic@@ opter
the helic@@ opter fle@@ w up various areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were rap@@ ed at the Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the im@@ hol@@ de in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,70 m tall , probably mas@@ k@@ ated , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies contributed . &quot;
they fled towards the city center .
the police put several strikes as well as a helic@@ opter .
the flag ran without success .
perhaps the unknow@@ ns were in fact close to the apartment or their flight .
