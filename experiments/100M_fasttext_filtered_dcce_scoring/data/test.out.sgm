<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf course in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, they drove home to the forage troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swear for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports assistant handed over the man from Anhausen within a small gala the golden sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for awards, it does not lessen the sympathetic athlete."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Cross-Cross, Silver Lorelleaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already begged him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means to me a lot," "says Langer," "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has promoted the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time winner winner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the founder, Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer's Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Ruderer's Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Rupert Peter-Michael Kolbe, the jumping runner Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are unequal in tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to brighten the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively go back to regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has a disadvantaged chance and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes are increased for the rich, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, there could be even cross-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart the coal mining industry in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in far-protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement intends to cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program:" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of us don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but rather simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger penny.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs to rise, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics respect him, so the deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman fled with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who flee alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby there which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realises that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences on her escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten them torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugboats demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who think that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the housing in the Munich south are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often fail to help, there are more than just for them, asking Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District Churches are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in shelving the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, women escaped not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are some common shelters or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or will be accommodated together with men and women, it may be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection, one can read at the crowds, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have talked about that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called on their union to approve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labor measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have administered to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained persistent, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challenged official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating working combat measures, beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes lead to the fact that assistants argued six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana, following the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions, had been recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he informed BMA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistant physicians and medical students, with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-speaking hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot refuse the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiled smiled, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like this would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm rather seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fight against the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the allegations of leading officials, that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse by President Erdogan he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been enthralled at a failed coup d'état almost his ministry last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harsh - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-imperial assault on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian import will be allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted transfer of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing crull about the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - that is pivotal to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian president certainly won a bonus for the attempted coup d" état in favour of elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deepening fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an analysis of the" alliance of outsiders ": two countries that violate themselves from the West, and are now being treated poorly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were told at the press conference that they did not even seize the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided addressing a question of their differences, while Putin chose to accentuate them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least once again talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin site, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the head of the log head and staff of the government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has secreted Moscow secretly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for a long time, Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest confidential Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - complainant post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office had violated the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another colleague Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four lockings of the" "outer blowers", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Keith Brown's economic minister today took a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is getting ready for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first lock represents a significant milestone in each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower located in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances of which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think that investors should become much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do I react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "concept of action" to the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it concerns the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be found in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the major dispute in the town hall was, however, said," How can you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as possible as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing project, which will cost millions of costs and will still be financed, is intended to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so frying:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of the Bratman, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program does not stand entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more about 1300 budget apartments whose funding is going out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, such as the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be redesigned to bring apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West city run out to the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased, it is far from the goal of so-called mix."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social-weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"chief executive Holger Herlitschke believes:" "for a wide majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more building sites for single-family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that no compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and child no longer walk outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many of the phenomena of pop culture, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pokémons who are tracking with a GPS and, once they were found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured "."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the cock and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game resulted in a considerable rise in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users recently informed the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of market launch, the number of downstream people running every day 30 minutes, by 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "because many public messages are boring and coming from people that look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overestimated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports reduces their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to address them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mürurian spoilers that must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even when smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and the use will be refunded by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with active players in the real world and help many people hunting, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">That is what I present under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnast women was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This indicates strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced."</seg>

<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won an individual competition event for women gold."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not look like sports classes across the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic partnership will only have four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks so that Turns are a more expensive sport and gymnast in the first place in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents supporting the training, setup, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued indefinitely."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the churches aun countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastic institution for 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness to flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, elective observations and town halls to ignore the proofs of electoral misuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethno and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister for Integration and Communal Government, who is now an anti-corruptionist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral channels in order to protect validated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a reference to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter only needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests, not removable inks on the finger of a person when they release their electoral vote to prevent someone elects twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only aimed at electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a Special Court decided that the veterinarian mayor Luton Rahman should be revealed after a litany of corrupted and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in cynical way" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have conducted his campaign on the basis, that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation, in which a person chooses someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarmingly to the fraudulent letter of letters - in the elder members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guide of instructors to prove their identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people in order to choose in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behaviour based on "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethno and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activist papers will work to stop" "election harvest". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is being considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks, in order to avoid that the electoral directory is used for immigration and social-betting purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable inks on the finger of a person once she gave her voice to prevent someone elects twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review on the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications to an automatic postage.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists deal with full briefings and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the police give the authority, set up barriers to set up election stations."</seg>
<seg id="30">A amendment made for intimidation pursuant to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Ordinance Law 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer ban in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training in order to ensure that employees rule the rule that voters go alone in the electoral cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Election Court has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as untaught," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "shut-off control" of the scribes of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country wears a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and hidden propagation of elective fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="1">Reisender Ian Wright shabt his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worgerfish of a serious test by hiding some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and Reiseautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted his course on a Euro Schein, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing cradle of a tensile toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us on what it is going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to the daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of detecting the rinsing button on a toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing he hid, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to rinsing pans of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitely among a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was meeting his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its propane showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to hide after their Luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That's the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not lick here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Lass gave us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in bowel health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the movie director, added:" let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had sparked some of the things I told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to put Ian on them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they should at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="26">"on the sheltered side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant administered to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delinquation is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be awful.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and have provided the information to us."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate consolation to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the Presidency of the Gülen-near Stiftung Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" a few hundred thousand, "the President of the President Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh precession of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime combats minorities and democratic opposition," says the president of Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already covered Kurdish highways with criminal actions three months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the putsch putsch, there are still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start new in Europe if they are further repressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state, which itself absorbs refugees, produced refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Association complained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"thus, Erdogan wants to increase the transfer pressure to the remaining cures."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," Toprak said. "</seg>

<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass over to the people shortly before the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in question clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"what is exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign, one sees from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through land, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-karger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and is chancellor Angela Merkel's guilt at the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, her" We create the "have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>

<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too bad anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast-CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on market places and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>

<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU campaigners Kokert to his fellow combatants is also self-declaring:" "you have to go there where people are: Dorffest, Golden weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is in the game, Sellering called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just under AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in surveys, should make the leap into the landmark."</seg>

<seg id="8">"the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen, and therewith the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed."</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partially considerable complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the traffic-related management of the refurbishment. "</seg>

<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 staff and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the note answered, the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation."</seg>

<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while I run in the midst of a bustling street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and let go wild before I stop, hold my hands and define something like this:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart Soho slowly buys in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men middle ages) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a sizable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford than they appeared and bought objects he sold when he was young and clever.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70ies, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I presumably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are causing them to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of partitions of the record revals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans are feeling overwhelmed by the digital world, and want to pull back to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that wrestle happier jubilations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is the case with me as a collector, and I think it's the case with many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage in spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "soldered an employee of a stack stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, have not yet stopped."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I blended up through a pile of Bossa Nova's compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men middle ages) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said," "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Record so that I can put them into a shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more produktble, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly reinforce."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has devoted the soundboard almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesis of synthesizer- and sexually thrilling pop in place of the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping spreader than a big shopping basket.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to bump my pants, I watch a group of young teenagers looking for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and sending some customers to the bottom Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collector's and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the bumblebees through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who outraged over the shoulders of nothing of middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French dish has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to sell 72 provisional businesses, in which people sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes are paid and which are a fire and security risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the dish that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups cannot offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the low-price was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in charitable and offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure was" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest are eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby arrived at the last hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a class class in handling, side stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to it in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have smashed a 15-man-team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for the UK - but it will probably not mean that at least a Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="12">Fiji began marvelously and let the attacks of the GBs jumped out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if you were going into driving coaches. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osew Kolinisau was raging in the corner."</seg>

<seg id="19">Vandero Ravouvou presided through further weak blacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to pause.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while the UK is still pired."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>

<seg id="4">"even if they were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present when they prevented the first women in the history of British sport, who put on such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough."</seg>

<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-richer morning with doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>

<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be ripped.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>

<seg id="5">So it was time ago in the original tone in a paper of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>

<seg id="7">"the work of the Veitenstein Group was" "Bavarian" "as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">"behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, was 28 years old as managing director."</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the potable water purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Broadbrunn, promotes approx. 150000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they expanded from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budget scheduling, calculation of fees and contributions to weekends," said the chairman. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as outstanding events, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), landed property in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the parts of water pipes."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was no standstill, and I have always added new additions, because water and drinking water were the most important food."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in her laudation she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years."</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few weeks ago, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate-lowering in front of the Upper Franconia Regional Forum."</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>

<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-driven German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the sector of green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for so-called self-production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers, the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when generators in the steel works are replaced by an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely fixed."</seg>

<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weakened, IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann stated in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further intensified when the world's largest producer of producer China cast masses of steel to the world market."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are presenting Chinese steel-concerted price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import tariffs are imposed on import steel effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price repetition is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus ThyssenKrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors Choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior singers sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, writes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "speaking and organizing to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly calls his lungs, does not get so quickly out of the powder in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs awakens a lot of memories in elderly people, often associated with positive feelings of her youth time."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia dislike for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a special achievement is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"elderly people, who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition, which one experiences through singing in the choir, writes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show itself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks of having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes beside her?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, seniors offer different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senselor's choir, one can simply join himself."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens screams are different with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>

<seg id="11">They were pre-played for a herd of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger rebelled kittens, who were additionally lifted up."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted to the cry," said Konerding. "</seg>

<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be congenital or developmental to the sexually mature.</seg>

<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to see a pattern, typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>

<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (safety level 2) suffered for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday accepted a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that bombs had been an attempt to stiff chaos, while the country moves toward stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, keeps herself confident of having led the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympics or World Records will not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia are so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks Habte became the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended with a resignation of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians got a special start from the International Swimming Association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in subordinated countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since in ethia most athletes walk, Habte simply wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred him as "Robel of Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "made him funny."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the appearance of the swimming pool from equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired back then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympia and never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest, if appropriate improvements are needed."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will lie at 4.37 Euro per cubic metre."</seg>

<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to access deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director, Herbert Schmidt presented the Board, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and overlappings from the previous period of calculation are to be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious bunker increases in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenditure, in the past period of the period not least due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenses."</seg>

<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the Welschenkahl pump station, the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and in the pond water plant Lopp had to operate the first sludge after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge was disposed, and an additional ventilation system could be installed in order to maintain the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses were the continued maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in the previous year 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low wastewater case in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully beat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"moreover, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in wastewater facilities has been spared over the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is an animator, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, it allows Snapchat around 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are distinctive, stand-alone twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All the miscarriages go to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have been criticised in which they have been accused of promoting Blackface promoting or propagating white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, there were some critics a racist cartoon of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely used on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it had disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought to be an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, that the filter was" vulnerable and blind "said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not punishable, but that the yellow face was drawn into the widening extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire.</seg>

<seg id="19">"and Snapchats great audience of young people, who are different in race as their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user," it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that" "racial contexts" "reflects a lack of diversity among settling practices at Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the largely white, only male leadership and ended up her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese Zhu," or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="5">"post-judging information typically dispatched by high-level CentCom commanders, reported a positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions allowed on site and were consistently positive as the analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The guiding errors in the CentCom range from the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their predecessors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest Mossul could start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the head of the Central Command changed the intelligence agencies to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, the CentCom reports are reported by the General Inspector of the Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly restricted process for the creation of respectable services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the Supreme Commander of the Committee of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence-related reports, "preached morality under analysts and" gave excessive amounts of space for deviating opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of an intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, who were recorded after complaints by CentCom Analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the general inspections were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has also made conclusions about the issue of a successful Air Campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the intelligence information about the Islamic state remind of customs of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, considered just a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led Mr. Hooker to address government agencies that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, this provisional refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, began to make things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work bench in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have ruined the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the seam area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank and then moved into the middle and led the ball into the gate to get a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of all the tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and invariably, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod which is handed down from the wristband to the swimmers to the gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a ladies black with dimples, could certainly have been among those known names that were sent to Prime Time, based on sponsors and well-being TV advertising when he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade, the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should be modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so sparsely noticed that many people, I had questioned, did not know that there is even an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had made an athlete to the final round of 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadian women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than for the Olympic games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enlightened enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact, but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging champions jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must end up a series of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to the execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallists have to go further, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the projection screen, but also another polishable goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator into tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she jumped off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and end-hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; which of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">"NBC will radiate the end-rounds as part of a weekday, on both days from 14.00 onwards."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to oversee in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by attaching and objectivity of male athlets - as the male US gymnasts proposed recently, Mr. Dooley expects his air from flying to air, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA"</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testify that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shake the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed on zig unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this land and in the future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, while dissidents were effectively brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and don't have any other options besides protesting, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a broad election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been imposed more or less in recent years, could use turbulence and re-arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hypocrisy are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopia had been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians attained that they were so called protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mostly come to Christian high countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under a screen," said Multicatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that are dominant around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death on a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special appointees to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively uninterrupted reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, which apparently pledged from the government according to analysts and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of riots went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharian town, conducted by Tigray and the hatred of the tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the U.S. and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for canon flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin grasping."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares that Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking his multiple claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founders "of the Islamic State's terrorist group, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates on whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellow combatants, who endeavour to take refuge during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of declaring declarations which he could not mean."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump went back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the excuse completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clintons's emails, but he later said, Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then relinquish it as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive and if necessary," "clarify" "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"however, I believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of blurring the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump assumed an even more dignified sound since its survey results have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advantage in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally tempted to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor wrong."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he emphasises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyalist comrades in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned to the correctness of Mr. Trumps claims whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization he called them" "Hinterbänkler", "completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream Republicans are attempting to argue that the government under Obama, in Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of guiding them on each of his words and taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You cannot!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked on Mr. Trumps innocence than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the menu on that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">"recently book" "Chop suey" "acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they show culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnaukellosem snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese wich with olive trees, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter asked Hackbraten, this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, gingerbread and savory bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that the ingredient is stretched.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE gringest.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put itself in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men of women boiled for male feline and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "stands out the ways with which the country went around to no longer be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans a central, tense subject," Coe begamed why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense as the new buddy: mysterious foods such as breads and kassers were staple food, the casserole as" wonderful species, food leftovers, "noted Ziegelman, since chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarity of a rarity."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixes were tried out, as a calorie rich and nourishing gratification had priority to taste or even healthy cooking."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also contains recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a favorite additive at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, an exaggerated fiscal policy - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country in such a way."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" budgetary women "and the challenge to transform Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-cake food-posture."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen in his kitchen, he fed up as the millionary man of the world to which he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked a continental breakfast like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terrific to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor asked him to statute a temple with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the caste of a housekeeper led to no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most trodden."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the age of Great Depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country came back on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in writing the book, the couple gave the eating habits of Ziegelmans mother-in-law better - for example, how they could not throw away food."</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland-shark: the oldest vertebral animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland haie received offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"on average, Greenland is swiftly swiftly on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five meter long animal speeds up 2.6 km / h, and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this, characterized by loneliness, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least one of Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan which represents a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed long that Grönland haie became stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, and finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin sealed coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only dip in the surface in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-motion-pumo measures it when they outlined up six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the loot makes these sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the iceberg and look for cadavers that torate from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-sharks who were catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the greatest 502 cm was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens already appears before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, your birth should be after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons search large amounts of this radioactive carbon tow into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, the lens core contained a slight overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons in which with 220 cm centimeters, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all the larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their liners, which result in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long, while the record shark might be 392 years old with 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Greenland only then got offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland sharks obviously span at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönland-wal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year old harpoon tip, was imprisoned in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the City of the Main has the best opportunities to shift jobs and companies from London."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly probable that Frankfurt benefits most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the IW. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether investors should continue to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU."</seg>

<seg id="9">"for Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), is responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance coverage of EIOPA and the ESRB."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"while Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it cuts as much as Dublin in the infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, the rent for first-class commercial property is 50 percent higher than the Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in a ranking of the company consulting Mercer the city stands on No.7, Luxembourg to No. 19, Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 37th place."</seg>

<seg id="3">"in 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charity purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book about their office hours in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidency, Senator Tim KAINE from Virginia, published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Holton."</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim KAINE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clintons campaign helpers Jennifer Palmieri in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retractors with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax statements."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obligated by law."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated the reason for his refusal to control tax audits by tax authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clintons campaign helpers Ian Sams on Twitter, referring to the publication of the presidency candidate of the Democrats. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, said to CNN, that he wouldn't allow Trump to release something before the tax inspections are not finished."</seg>
<seg id="12">"among other things, the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already clarified that his refusal to raise issues relating to assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his business models and various other connections, particularly with Russia."</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already overthrown itself on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks for its tax return.</seg>

<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billionaire and Investor Warren Buffett which would make sure people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>

<seg id="8">"from Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau stands and so the pilgrim took place from the Muenster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writing texts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner traveled last night in the Men's Sprint in Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the lead that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had turned himself to Eigen. the Jungspund made the legend proud when he went home to take a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy repeated the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they picked up in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the resignation Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Hoy's retirement generated a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close."</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the villi that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinds, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy conquered - and Skinner were competing in the qualification round, but in the standard-hours the New Zealanders won in the first lap."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinds left behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, with the passing in a higher gear, to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell from Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they climbed to the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to give me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys page there was notice that after a weak start he fell intentionally on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindes said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly left with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, seven of ten titles gained in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days at the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a prey of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That came from Hoy the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medalist contest of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, who won gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will definitely focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification, when functionaries were calling him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's contest, which will continue and terminated tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archive of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to collect a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in April, Dramas withdrew in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid Sexism and Mobbingproposals, as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite soon as if the legendary reputation GBs, which reached the perfect moment its climax, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy yield questionably</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supplier agreement and thus to lift all delivery contracts as the energy company ran out."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subvention established for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominance effects since the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the entire production of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which last year led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting," shared the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continues to say that the contracts are so-called" "backup deals", "which will have effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared that the value of the contracts has already been written in its annual subscription amounting to $187 million in anticipation of a cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the ability to use the" "ability of Alcoas..." "to operate melting or do not impair the power of smelting."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010, a 20 year treaty signed with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts were in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, it would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Timpe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather knock."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would now range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "took over 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"however, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit's computer fair in Hanover, as an" office in the west bank format. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for damp standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, including by fax, the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, albeit tortured slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the prize was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus around 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Handy-Sparte of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market leaders dominate vendors who came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people daily."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented wheelchairs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third running steg, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police seize witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman slept in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, said police in Vaud."</seg>

<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, inherited atmosphere and still slowly moving."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-size of the Sun almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella, to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planets scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly inhabitable, the Venus -- over several billion years --exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned out of the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydro, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail users are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies over the past twelve months have been at least once, partly multiple victims of an assassination with blackmailed software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ranking of rankings."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the solution level required by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blacksmith's software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to redeeming ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the pollutants," says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacking took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches specifically for unchanging files such as Word-, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmailers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production still stands."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute by the loss of sick acutely."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers have investigated the usage areas and contact with the agents and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be hard negotiated and pay five-digit totals to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is likely, however, that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their pollutants in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the so-called malware-Kits were created by installing the malware, providing advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price of $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmith searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set from a criminal and mandates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per authenticated computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals endure spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey rely on how to repel Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption alone is no sufficient threat to successful performance, the offenders are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price scales," "says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in this way, the potential for damage depends on the type of data even higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the little HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a Minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit surface is falling."</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles the HR-V is in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"not only a trunk of 453 l is available with raised and 1026 l with reversed back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cauldron and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, however, the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="13">"the daily consumption is 4,7 l / 100 km."</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the City Emergency Assistant is part of the security systems (operates at speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warner sometimes irritates, because when maneuvering many obstacles than" "approaching objects". ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The long-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent tailgate responds to the traffic sign recognition and choke at demand the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"if you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline engine will receive from 20000 Euro, diesel from 23000 Euro."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against insomnia</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you are rolling around for hours, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake of the cheque-ringing anymore to think about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders say?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one regards, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an inlet and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"especially the passage of passage many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member in the German Hausärzler Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is frequent above all with depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a disc-disk incident can lie poorly, wakes up every two or three hours and may possibly start to salute about everyday problems and worries, Weeks has an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should you be with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"those who have not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights a week, should go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or drugs - classical sleeping tablets just in exceptional cases, and at most for two weeks - inquery."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any practised sleep mediator in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems one should first turn to the general practitioner, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can determine whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the dorm laboratory, physicians, for example, in snoring with breathing placements, in case of diseased fatigue, in case of sleeping sickness or when one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a midday sleep," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cloning, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitch screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watching TV for sleeping, stopping drinking alcohol and at night not at the watch - then you start to anticipate immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, some lime trees, in between still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police are among the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a beolshop."</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy district", "as the responsible real estate company, Friedrichshain, is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator Henkel recorded several times for a tough action by the police against the project, called the" No-Go-Zone "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede were evacuated, patrolled the police three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the construction workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in vorm Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main organ of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are mainly generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wished for majority police protection from the vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police force between house-occupants and their neighbors, does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, which today in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average rate and a high risk of poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga region."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liners around the world over the past few years: with them, residents from GDR times and former homeowners share their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on sworn disks or newly painted facades that have been subjected to dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year, together with the words" "centre-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbors who regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body violation, statistics, according to statistics, are reported almost exclusively against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes constitute material damage, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly refurbished houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous fireflies do not give it any longer in the Riga region anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal concern, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the residents had to get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly stressed the interpretation of interpretation in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through sighted newbuilds in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many - here rather people live, who are not as good as they are," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction cannot be justified."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the Haugans and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the Bauhof or help house-masters, do-profit-making work - and that motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, saying Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here for administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain the refugees that it just takes time and it can be bridged the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, should not work, and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there is also a problem, the customer says honestly," people, with whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always too motivated to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what mancher may call naive." a residual risk and does not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers were sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put them in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to provide helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already able to integrate the previous people at a reasonable price.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
